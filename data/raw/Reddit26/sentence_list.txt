Cannot wait for Samsara
1
Thanks again Reddit!
2
I realized that I had this movie on my 1001 movies you should read before you die list, and I would have eventually gotten to it, but it's great that I got to discover this in a different way.
3
I always wonder what happened to the random people filmed in Koyaanisqatsi.
4
Are they still alive?
5
Where are they now?
6
Does anyone else wonder this?
7
He obviously isn't up to date on what's going on in the Marvel movie world.
8
Yeah, you set ol' Stan straight dude
9
Usually father/son stuff, and husband/wife stuff.
10
I balled my eyes out during The Road, as well as Take Shelter.
11
I don't have any brothers.
12
But I have a father and a wife, so I'm biased here.
13
It still seems hard for special FX teams to make humans transition between CGI shots and real shots in order to do physically impossible or superhuman feats.
14
For example, in the beginning of The Bourne Legacy, a man jumps from a tree down to the ground, a distance of about 20 feet, and it's painfully obvious that it's a shot of him in the tree blended to a CGI body/alt shot of him falling, blended to a shot of him landing.
15
They've CGI'd people in costumes, but so far I haven't seen any successful version of what I just described.
16
STEVE HOLT!
17
I think they should make a movie about Abraham Lincoln's history as a vampire slayer, and how it affected our country.
18
Wait, they already did that?
19
Any future chick flicks: Guy meets a girl, can't be with the girl because she has a boyfriend/disease/something holding her back.
20
They bond, fall in love.
21
Something pulls them apart again, but their love prevails and they live happily ever after.
22
Oh, and for extra sadness, someone dies.
23
I've never seen anyone suggest it but I thought Hide and Seek was a pretty good psychological thriller.
24
Going to see x-men first class, a movie I had been looking forward to for a really long time, only to have it be ruined by the dumb girl sitting next to me, who didn't put her fucking phone away cause she had to keep checking fucking facebook throughout the whole thing.
25
I can't tell you how hard it was to resist the temptation to pull it from her hand, and tell her she's not getting it back till it's over.
26
Mostly all of my unpleasant experiences involve that, cell phone shit, other than that, well, seeing Transformers 2, withhold your judgement, with a bunch of fucking kids the whole time was another, everything goes fine for me.

The Sword and The Sorcerer http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084749/
28
A professor at my university was part of the crew.
29
The stuntman jumped off a cliff and missed the target.
30
She saw it happen.
31
They ended production for the day.
32
They asked his family and they said to use the footage, because it's what he would have wanted.
33
EDIT: I found this blog where someone else who was there describes it.

35
Blood Simple, Zodiac, The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye, Night Moves, haven't seen it, but it's supposed to be good, Manhunter.
36
Really enjoyed it.
37
As far as character acting goes, Hardy is impeccable.
38
Plus, Super Hans.
39
"A Love Song For Bobby Long" with John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson.
40
The Big Lebowski.
41
And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies.
42
And then, they would fear you.
43
The Godfather
44
I remember seeing this one in the theater back when it was released.
45
Without knowing anything about it, I found it sufficiently creepy (especially the last shot).
46
Now, though -- especially after viewing several hundred films just like this one -- I can only approach it as pure comedy.
47
Movies like this are far too campy to be taken seriously and Sleepaway Camp now only works as a very funny period piece at best.
48
The Notebook.
49
i can't remember the name, but the movie is about people who steal some sacred elephants and eat them, and the shepard gets all pissed a finds them, anyway the fight is a single take on a steadicam.
50
as the guy is fighting like 50 people and bodyguards in a hotel
51
Kirk vs. Gorn.
52
I seriously expected to see 5 pictures of him in full metal jacket
53
y u no have plan 9 poster?
54

56
THE ROOM!
57
i have only one thing to say about troll 2.OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
58
good movies to watch if your sad: the big lebowski, midnight in paris, or the many adventures of winnie the pooh.
59
take my last suggestion into consideration.
60
also maybe they should have given him a motive.
61
this might not be your thing, but watch Trigun: Badlands Rumble.
62
based off the tv show, but it's really good.
63
the big lebowski, and midnight in paris
64
from dusk til dawn.
65
anyone whos seen it knows why i was caught off guard.
66
masque of the red death.
67
based on the hammer horror version.
68
i love the story, and i think tim burtons artistic style could give it some new life.
69
i did'nt like big daddy in kick-ass.
70
in the movie they made him an actual baddass cop on revenge, but in the comic he reveals to kickass that he was just a nerd like him that made money selling comic books.
71
he made up the story.
72
when i'm sad i watch the many adventures of Winnie the pooh.
73
and my tears of sadness change to tears of joy, and love for my innocent childhood character.
74
i'm sorry i fucking love Winnie the pooh.
75
thank god, fuck that homophobic religious nutcase.
76
demanding the movie be pg-13, fuck him
77
that's the stuff of nightmares.
78
Jesus.
79
'You stay, I go.
80
No following' 'Superman' For some reason -even though I know the ending- that scene in Iron Giant gets me blubbering like an idiot.
81
Still gets to me that it's Vin Diesel doing the voice though.
82
Blah.
83
When is this moving coming to the US? IMDB says it came out in January 2012 but I never heard of this film until recently.
84
I do enjoy X-Men 3 mainly because "I'M THE JUGGERNAUT, BITCH!"
85
The best ones have already been said, so I'll give you a long shot.
86
Green Street Hooligans
87
It did make me wash my hands more, but other than that, no effect.
88
A disease like that could never spread too far.
89
It would have to have a a much longer dormancy period.
90
If you show signs in a day and died in 3-4 it can't spread.
91
This is why prions (i.e.
92
mad cow disease) are scary.
93
They can lay dormant for 10 years (although that is not spread by simple person to person contact).
94
Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World.
95
I'm sure most people on here like it, but everyone I know, that's not into old school video games or a movie buff, hates it.
96
Alec Guiness and Ewan Mcgregor as obi wan kenobi
97

Hans Zimmer - Time (Inception)
101
The badder the better as far as I'm concerned.
102
Plan 9 From Outer Space is my all time favourite and Glen or Glenda runs a close second.
103
Actually I love anything by Ed Wood, time for a re-watch, thanks for the reminder.
104
:)
105
Hobo with a shotgun
106
The trick I learned when watching this, was that you have to time it correctly.
107
I was bored and heard I should watch it one weekend afternoon while it was light out, couldn't make it more than 10 minutes in, but I found it interesting, but that it wasn't getting anywhere.
108
Fast forward to the week after, Friday night, 1 AM, tired, a little out of it, but hyped up on caffeine.
109
That's when I made it through the whole movie.
110
And it was visceral, wonderful, frightening, all at the same time.
111
I JUST finished watching it.
112
For some reason, the acting didn't bother me after about 15 minutes.
113
I think it's because I was told about the ending(no spoilers) so I was really into it, and looking forward to finding out what happens.
114
Could you be more specific about what made it so bad?

119
Star Wars Episode I: The Rebellion Order Master Yoda, leader of the Jedi has returned to Alderaan after being in hiding for over 200 years preparing for the great war.
120
He warns the return of a powerful enemy who was thought to be dead, a sith lord who is a master the dark side of the force.
121
His word spreads across the entire system and all members of the Jedi Council are looked to for help.
122
The Jedi are now merely peacekeepers of the Galaxy, prophets who protect the innocent never seeking fame or reward.
123
The Outer Rim systems fall under control of a federation to deplete all of their resources to secretly build an all powerful weapon, The Death Star.
124
A young man who has been a slave his entire life always looking to the stars every night realizes he has abilities no one else does.
125
He can begin to control minds, move objects, even has visions of the future.
126
He secretly trains and becomes stronger as he gives into his emotions, no one has ever helped him before and his anger makes him more powerful by the day.
127
He leads his fellow slaves in revolt to the droid army and fights nearly to the death when nearly all is lost a Jedi Master arrives and destoys the entire battalion of droids, it's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
128
He sensed him from nearly half way across the galaxy and tells young Anakin Skywalker he is the prophet that the Jedi have been waiting for to bring balance to the force.
129
He wants to bring him to see Master Yoda so that he may be trained in the ways of a Jedi knight.
130
Anakin is hesitant and questions why he is needed now and why his people have suffered so long.
131
Obi-Wan explains an ancient tale of his people and the Sith.
132
All life in the universe is created by the force, the Jedi have never sensed a threat in the Outer Rim and realizes that they have failed and neglected the people of his planet.
133
With the Jedis help, Anakin can bring his home world of Tattooine back into its utopian state it once was.
134
They arrive on an uninhabitable planet Dagobah with Yoda to train in seclusion, all this time Anakin becomes stronger and a cunning warrior.
135
As they train a mysterious hooded figure with a cane creeps towards a window of his ship to look down as its about to descent to a landing pad, below are millions of troops loading into other ships to other parts of the galaxy.
136
Order 66 is set to kill the Jedi across the galaxy and set up an occupation within the worlds of the Republic.
137
A trusted Jedi (really Darth Maul) is in contact with Obi-Wan during Anakins training.
138
He wants to bring the entire council together to control the senate and the republic with the upcoming war looming.
139
The clone army's begin a massive attack cutting short Anakins training.
140
All 3 of them return to Alderaan to meet the Jedi council.
141
Bail Organa, leader of the senate gives absolute control of the republic to the Jedi to protect them during this crisis, but he and his fellow kings will build up their own factions against this threat.
142
Yoda brings the Jedi together and tells them the secret he has kept hundreds of years about the sith.
143
There is a sith lord whom he has battled all this time who was a pupil of his now named Darth Sidious.
144
He betrayed Master Yoda and the Jedi with his desire to control the galaxy by unleashing the dark side of the force learning the ways of the Sith with ancient texts/ spirits.
145
At this point Darth Maul begins attacking his fellow Jedi killing dozens easily as thousands of clone troopers arrive.
146
Obi-Wan is nearly killed but is protected by Anakin who is the only one who can match the intensity of him.
147
Darth Sidious arrives in time to assist Darth Maul and Anakin begins to weaken until he resorts to instinct and his hate begins to take over.
148
Yoda senses this and uses all his power to defend Anakin.
149
Sidious and Maul (who is gravely injured) escape into Slave I and Jango Fett speeds off into light speed.
150
So few Jedi remain but Obi-Wan leads them in a speech that they must protect the galaxy at all costs.
151
The worlds are simultaneously being taken over by clone armys.
152
Bail Organa and his army arrive too late to help and he is devistated.
153
He puts out a call across the galaxy to all kings/ leaders that with the Jedi on their side, they will rebel against this tyrannical empire and peace will be restored both to the republic and to the outer rim.
154
Yoda is weak and tells Obi-Wan he is the leader of the council now, he must return to Dagobah to recover and learn new ways of the force because of the visions he has had.
155
Obi Wan understands the threat Anakin poses but feels he can control is anger with further training as they embark to Kashyyyk with Bail Organa and his army to gain more planets help in the Clone War.
156
Sidious is overlooking Darth Maul as he is being surgically repaired into the leader of his clone army.
157
General Grevious as behind him in the window, we see the Death Star beginning construction.
158
Is this interesting at all?
159
I will continue if anyone else likes where this is going.
160
Star Wars Episode II: Mutiny of The Sith Star Wars Episode III: Fall of The Old Republic
161
I like to count the demon in Insidious as the return of Darth Maul.
162
For some reason, they gave him new fuzzy legs and hair in hell.
163
Then threw in a little DNA from Animal(of Muppets fame) just as a punishment to draw him from his previous badassness.
164
I would have to say its part of his public persona.
165
Man to man he knows he doesn't want to fight Rocky again, but when your career and reputation are on the line all bets are off.
166
He had to do immediate damage control in the hospital to downplay the travesty that just happened.
167
Pretty disappointed, this is just the stuff on the Blu-Ray which I've seen several times.
168
All of the Studio Ghibli films.
169
And work your way backwards, starting with the newest films in bluray 1080p, stepping back in time back to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (not technically a Ghibli film, but it was in spirit and by the same director).
170
It lets you appreciate the fact that it's really all about the story, and all of the advances in animation and technical wizardry aren't required, but are rather merely embellishment.
171
Aside from Ghibli films: Grave of the Fireflies for a tear jerker.
172
Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade for stylized drama thriller.
173
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust for romantic Gothic horror in the vein of Castlevania.
174
Robot Carnival for charming vignettes.
175
Appleseed is a must watch movie :)
176
'Metropolis' (2001)
177
Ghost in the Shell
178
It's already been said, but I must stress that PAPRIKA is most certainly worth a watch.
179
Juice
180
Braveheart always reminds me of the winter, because it was the first movie of its kind that I really sat down and devoted my attention to as a teenager.
181
I had the flu, it was bitter cold outside, and I was too weak to get up and play Nintendo games.
182
All of the Underworld films, and Blade 1 and 2. TRON Legacy seems to get a bad wrap but I adore it.
183
I read somewhere that Brando and Kilmer were extremely difficult to work with during filming and both kept adding their own personal (and awful, in this case) touches.
184
Black Swan.
185
I must have been living under a rock because I had heard nothing about it until opening night when a few friends dragged me in while at the mall.
186
I briefly glanced at the poster and was expecting some kind of indie drama.
187
Instead it blew me away.
188
Mmmm young Monica Belluci.
189
A work of art that woman is.
190
The Legend of Billie Jean with modern social and political issues.
191
Social media, et al, to spread the word rather than tapes sent to the media.
192
Black Death, the evisceration.
193
13 Assassins, Fist of Legend, and the immortal Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
194
Think of what it would be like to have empirical evidence of a peaceful afterlife.
195
As sure as you can demonstrate that water will boil at a certain temperature at sea level.
196
The elves have that knowledge.
197
Perhaps that makes it easier for some to let go and risk their life.
198
Maybe it makes it even harder for some knowing that they can never enjoy Middle Earth again, when they have the option of doing so for eternity.
199
Personally I think their sacrifice was the same as any man, since they all had everything to lose if Sauron had won.
200
When the protagonist deciphers an age-old mystery that has perplexed historians and anthropologists for decades by glancing through a book/diary/log.
201
I found the movie to be above average, a perfectly adequate science fiction film set in that universe.
202
The franchise was on a decline with T3, and Salvation didn't offer anything new, compelling, or inspiring.
203
It certainly wasn't good or provoking enough to re-energize the series or give it a new launching point to move forward from.
204
So I think that since it didn't generate excitement or renew interest in the Terminator films it kind of feels like it killed it, but it really just arrived and left with a whimper.
205
Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Carey Mulligan.
206
They wouldn't always need to be the headliners - I think both have the range to always be able to fill a role in any movie I'd be filming.
207
Period drama, action movie, historical epic, science fiction.
208
I could see them in anything.
209
I'll probably get downvoted for this, but 500 Days of Summer.
210
why the FUCK would you put the spoiler in the title?
211
You cunt.
212
get out.
213
Real Genius.

Lesson: It is not a good idea to flood your dorm hallway so you can ice skate indoors.

The Sure Thing.
216
Lesson: Daphne Zuniga and Nicolette Sheridan were even more hot when they were young.
217
I would like Michael Mann making the films he use to make before Collateral, Miami Vice, and Public Enemies.
218
I don't have a huge problem with Collateral, but that's when he started changing.
219
I want to see him do heist movies like Heat or Thief.
220
I love how he's meticulous and make such cool gun fights.
221
christopher nolan do a james bond movie
222
I like Chan-Wook Park.
223
Maybe to see him do a serial killer movie and really flesh out the character.

227
Yes, Madam.
228
It's a very cheesy movie, but when there's action, you'll be impressed.
229
You can just watch the fight scenes on youtube if you don't want to watch it.
230
This movie has the best fight scenes with women I have ever seen.
231
Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock were great action stars back then.
232
Kung Fu Hustle Iron Monkey Dragon Tiger Gate Fighter in the Wind Fist of Legend Rumble in the Bronx City of Violence
233
The Sword in the Stone
234
The Boondock Saints
235
I like that they mention one of the directors also directed the movie Mother.
236
That movies pretty awesome.
237
How do they not have Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, or Sympathy for Lady Vengeance?
238
The former is pretty amazing and the cinematography in the latter is some of the best I've ever seen.
239
Those two are Park films like Old Boy.
240
He probably had lots of family issues, which is why he appreciates the grandmother more than the father and son and explains to them that they took her for granted.
241
I've seen it.
242
Pretty good.
243
Parent/child.
244
See Noriko's Dinner Table.
245
I wish I could say it was just the execution that let me down.
246
But also it's just such an obvious piecing together of stuff we've seen before, and the twist at the end was pretty weak and predictable.
247
I couldn't get into the monsters either.
248
I remember seeing Reservoir Dogs a long time ago before I really understood who Tarantino was.
249
I wasn't particularly impressed.
250
Strange Circus.
251
That movie is the biggest mind fuck ever.
252
I also really like Noriko's Dinner Table.
253
It made me very emotional.
254
To me everything.
255
It's just sad to see people give up on old special effects and animatronics when cgi still isn't that convincing sometimes.
256
A noun.
257
Still can't believe that movie was technically made in the '70s.
258
It's unbelievable.
259
I thought the dialogue in Up in the Air was very authentic.
260
It helps that it had an amazing cast that did the script justice.
261
Jaws.
262
I just watched this again recently and I love how genuine everyone in it acts.
263
Especially Brody and his wife.
264
They are one of the most realistic married couples I've seen in a movie.
265
Kynodontas.
266
Dancer in the Dark.
267
I get depressed just thinking about film.
268
As wonderful and spectacular as it is, I can't watch it more than once every few months without spiraling into a pit of sadness.
269
Remo Williams.
270
Staring Nathan Fillion.
271
Argo and Looper.
272
Mmm, attempting to screenshot from films is difficult as they generally use a fairly slow shutter speed.like
273
1/50th I believe.
274
They do this so that 24fps doesn't look choppy.
275
You'd be better off looking for actual photographs taken on set.
276
You could also head over to Blu-Ray.com and look at their screenshots on their reviews.
277
They're very good.
278
absolutely loved the trailer especially the last 20 seconds.
279
my favorite movie ever.
280
Probably could have done without the robot fart when Vader ignites his saber (that sound effect needs to die) but this isn't bad overall.
281
Nice idea.
282
Night and the City from 1950, directed by Jules Dassin who also did The Naked City and Rififi.
283
It's not a detective film but is most certainly a noir, about an ambitious wrestling promoter who struggles against the odds to book the fight of the century.
284
Great stuff, textbook use of chiaroscuro and an unhinged performance from the great Richard Widmark.
285
I'm Dick Tracy, Take that Prune Face!
286
Now I'm Prune Face, Take that Dick Tracy!
287
Now I'm Prune Tracy, Take that Dick F.
288
I saw Beatty not long ago eating in a restaurant.
289
He looks like he's in good shape (though older).
290
He still has the rights and I believe still plans on making a sequel.
291
I hope he does.
292
He directed the heck out of this and I'm sorry he didn't get the accolades he deserved.
293
I read that because the comics only used 4 colours, when they designed the colour pattern for the movie, they kept that in mind and only used a limited palette of 7 colours.
294
This was too keep the movie true to its roots.
295
We used to watch this movie a ton when my brother and I were growing up and it was only in the more recent viewings did we notice how much shit Dick Tracy eats while jumping to that lampost.
296

297
I caught this movie on TV when I was really young and I just remember it being super awesome
298
It's one of my favorites.
299
I enjoyed it and everyone did a great job, and really impressed how close it was to the comics, including the make up.
300
They truly made them like the characters.
301
To think, I thought this when I was a kid.
302
Drive.
303
I knew it looked stylish and cool, but when that certain moment with Christina Hendricks happened, me and my friends all stood up and went "OH SHIT"
304
I do.
305
Disney made some great animated movies.
306
Got me into animation and drawing.
307
Aladdin, Mulan, Tangled, Mermaid and Great Mouse Detective we're fabulous.
308
I just rented Emperor's New Groove and Hercules and they were amazing.
309
I can't FUCKING believe this script!
310
From the end sequence: Mikey spots his Trainees approaching.
311
One in particular catches his eye.
312
It's a SMOKING HOT TURTLE CHICK.
313
She smiles at Mikey.
314
He smiles back.
315
SMOKING HOT TURTLE CHICK Michael Bay.WHAT IN THE FUCK WERE YOU ON? (P.S.
316
I didn't capitalize the words "Smoking Hot Turtle Chick."
317
That's how it was written IN.
318
THE.
319
SCRIPT.)
320
I'm about halfway through it.
321
The dialogue is pretty awful and they make Casey Jones a whiny little bitch, but the absolute funniest thing is how bizarrely corny the action descriptions are: THICK CURVED BLADES EJECT THROUGH SCHRADER'S SKIN ?
322
HIS BODY IS SUDDENLY COVERED IN THEM.
323
WTF! .and.
324
April recoils, trying to pull away.
325
But CASEY LEVELS THE FOOT WITH A POWER-SHOT RIGHT TO THE SWEET SPOT.
326
.and.
327
The Turtles hang on to the back of the subway car by a finger (OR THREE).
328
RAPH LETS THE SHURIKEN FLY–– THE PROJECTILE SNAGS THE GRENADE BETWEEN THE BOUCHON AND LEVER ARM, dangling it on the wall between Bebop and Rocksteady, who's wearing the pin-ring like a wedding band.

331
Leo LUNGES for Raph.
332
AS THE SIBLING SMACKDOWN BEGINS !
333
.and, to describe a "TINY BLOW DART" hitting a guard's neck: "THWAAAAAAP!"
334
(six A's, I shit you not).
335
I actually put less emphasis on those than the script did because I don't know how to underline.
336
Also, Raphael has a tendency to tuck into his shell and do barrel-rolls, and the writer is prone to a disturbingly constant misuse of the term "eyefucking".
337
Dear Mr. Bay, Fuck you, you degenerating bag of dick-cunts.

Let me Guess Micheal Serra plays Casey Jones and Kristen Stewart plays April O'NealMicheal Bay needs a Lobotomy with no Anesthetic
340
That is a really horrible script, that doesn't even make any sense.
341
"Because one thing that dangerous escaped mutants need to do is listen to the shit-head human that they didn't know an hour ago, and do everything he says"
342
OK, who else wants to chip in money for an assassin?
343
I am fucking furious after reading this.
344
Someone needs to rape Michael Bay like he rapes childhood memories.
345
retarded also, T-U-R-T-L-E.
346
POWER! .
347
that is all
348
I don't know about you guys, but I'm really curious as to what eyefucking would look like.
349
I truly do believe now that the Giant turtle that holds up our planet in space is in fact God.
350
And even he/she/it knows not to fuck with the Turtles.
351
all hail our new turtle overlords.
352
Good god that blog design is just so godawful!
353
Sorry, but, its green pixelated background combined with almost invisible and a disorganized wall of text is almost as atrocious as what they were going to to TMNT
354
After watching the Transformers movies I swore I would never watch a Michael Bay movie again.
355
He ruined one thing from my childhood and would do so again with this Turtles crap.
356
The man does not understand a good movie.
357
He thinks lots of explosions and sexy women make a good movie.
358
He thinks his audience are stupid and thus makes stupid movies for them.
359
He does not understand that you can make big blockbuster movies which can be a little more intelligent like Nolan does.
360
I hate Bay.
361
I wish he would not try and get his hands on projects beloved of so many.
362
If he has to make his crap movies at least come up with his own stuff and stop stomping all over things much loved by the general populous.
363
Damn, my prediction was so close.
364
I had Baxter Stockman as the douchy high schooler no one gives a shit about, who gets 90% of the screen time chasing big titted, empty headed, high school reporter April O'Neal.
365
Upvoted in hope that maybe more people will read it and organise a global tomato pelting movement with Michael Bay as the only target.
366
Can someone post a link to download that or view it other than in Google Docs?
367
urge to kill, rising.
368
Jesus fucking christ.
369
They need to stop giving Bay money.
370
Point blank.
371
This is like paint by numbers, only with movies.
372
No wonder the movie got cancelled.
373
Casey Jones?
374
like the band?
375
I refuse to believe this is real.
376
TELL ME IT ISN'T REAL.
377
holy crap!
378
Kill it before it reproduces!
379
This reminds me of what Shyamalan did to The Last Airbender.
380
No sanity in the entire script.
381
Literally.

It has taken me 13 hours to get to page 22.
384
My reward is .
385
bowling turtles.
386
BOWLING.
387
TURTLES.
388
His worst fears were revealed?
389
Or were they realized?
390
Well, at least they're still mutated turtles.
391
Ulysses/Odysseus.
392
It has the potential to be so insanely badass based on the book.
393
But it was turned into a shitty Scy Fy Channel movie.
394
It would be cool if it were done with the animation style of Beowulf.
395
That would be cool cus I would love a poster of Abe Lincoln from Whitest Kids.
396
The torture scene in Casino Royale.
397
YEEEEEES!
398
I liked when they were both brothers.
399
Cast Away.
400
I loved Pandorum.
401
I also patiently waited for it to come out in theaters, to later realize it had already been released in theaters, on my birthday, and I missed it.
402
I love the twists and turns it takes.
403
My big favor towards Pixar has been they don't do musicals.
404
But I was also pretty impressed with Tangled.
405
I even thought the musical parts were really well done and catchy.
406
I have high hopes for both companies.
407
I'm epsecially looking foward to Pixar's coming dinosaur movie (FINALLY!), and a movie on the Day of the Dead which will be interesting.
408
watched the original in media class recently.the
409
remake's more watchable, but the first is just so much better.
410
just dated.
411
One of the best remakes of all time.
412
Beverly Hills Cop and Rush Hour 2
413
The Other Guys, Team America, Machete, The A-Team.
414
Cop Out
415
Red Tails is the worst movie ever made.
416
Interesting tidbit, "for all mankind" is a play on Armstrong's famous line, but also for what Ben Johnson said about Shakespeare, he's "a bard not for an age, but for all mankind."
417
High Fidelity is almost the absolute perfect movie for this.
418
In the last 15 minutes Spoiler
419
Le Samourai
420
How about David Boreanaz as Booth?
421
Hanz Zimmer - Inception theme.
422
One of the best ones to date.
423
Game of Death used footage from the actual funeral of Bruce Lee
424
I believe in wizard of oz a person commits suicide by hanging.
425
It's in the background of one of the scenes.
426
Im to lazy to find a link.
427
i thought it sucked.
428
Best zombie movie ever.
429
Well ya know, without any zombies.
430
But think about it: this film has absolutely every emotion and feeling that every aspiring zombie-story-teller tries to infuse into their stories.
431
Except this film manages to do it realistic and effortlessly.
432
I'd love to see a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
433
Update it with all the shit going on right now in American politics.
434
That would sell!
435
I am willing to see this, but I swear to God if it is anything like Speed Racer I will find those siblings and tear them limb from limb.
436
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !
437
pulp fiction butt rape scene
438
21 Jump Street is funny !
439
Battleship - the 1st 30mins sucks but at lest the ship battles are cool.
440
Gone - its ok Safe House - is a bad ass movie !
441
Plot summary, please, anyone?
442
Otherwise doesn't sound too convincing; "if you like great movies, and you happen to like watching films on Saturday night, than boy do I have a suggestion for you.
443
It's called Riki Oh, it's asian, you'll love it."
444
. Cause the inclusion of certain actors doesn't guarantee the success of a movie.
445
You're thinking like a producer.
446
Fargo was filmed in my neck of the woods, so I definitely associate it with winter.
447
Scott Pilgrimm vs. the World in NovemberFour Brothers in December (not the greatest movie but since I've seen it like a "dozen" times it has become an habbit)
448
Little Lord Fauntleroy (1980) is THE Christmas movie for me.
449
The Ref- Christmas.
450
Bambi- fall/spring.
451
V for Vendetta- fall.
452
Patch Adams- late summer/fall.
453
The Ghost and the Darkness- summer despite being around Christmas time.
454

456
Homeward Bound- fall.
457
101 Dalmatians- Winter.
458
Pi from Darren Aronofsky.A Beautiful Mind from Ron Howard (not really a thriller but exactly what you're looking for)
459
Up
460
Gah, what's the point in reviewing trailers?
461
It's like reviewing the blurb on the back cover of a novel.
462
They run on two hydrogen fuel cells, arnie explains this in T3 and Kyle Reese uses a bunch of them to blow up skynet in Terminator:Salvation
463
sunshine kinda.
464
space makes me get psychological
465
Les diaboliques Memento Vertigo Basic Instincts The Game Black Swan The Silence Of The Lambs Seven Fatal Attraction Misery Primal Fear But, by far the best psychological thrillers are Vertigo and Les diaboliques.
466
You have to watch them.
467
They practically invented psychological thriller subgenre.
468

469
Orphan.
470
Memento, the king of all psychological thrillers.
471
Identity,The Game, The Killing Room, Hard Candy, Funny Games
472
The Lion King.
473
Because of its wonderful music soundtrack by Elton John and Hans Zimmer, and because of its great story telling in that it is basically Shakespeare's Hamlet but with lions.
474
'Mulan' and 'Beauty and the Beast', i love those movies dearly.
475
No.
476
my grandma used to read to me from a big golden book of Disney stories when i was little.
477
turns out my favorite story, Briar Rabbit (because the pictures were cool and my grandma has a southern accent), is a part of the Song of the South movie, arguably the most racist movie Disney made.my
478
grandmas from Alabama.im not sure what to think about it.
479
i rewatch classic disney all the time, just yesterday i watched 20,000 leagues under the sea and 101 dalmations.
480
good movie,never even noticed it had michael douglas in it.
481
their animation heyday was the 90s, and i was a child of the 90s, so you bet i watch animated disney movies : P
482
Mulan on VHS.
483
I like to think I'm lucky I haven't watched the sequels.
484
I watch aladdin and mulan regularly.
485
EDIT: Emperor's new groove also.
486
Beauty and the Beast.
487
I am very secure with my masculinity too.
488
So secure about it that I tell everyone how secure I am about it before I say something that may draw it into question.
489
Great Mouse Detective.
490
Sword in the Stone.
491
3
492
Robin Hood.
493
Costner's got nothing on Brian Bedford.
494
Mulan isn't just one of my favorite childhood movies.
495
It's one of my favorite movies, period.
496
Edit: I noticed that a lot of people on this thread are mentioning underrated Disney not-so-classics.
497
So I'd like to also throw out "Fox and the Hound" and "Brave Little Toaster", the latter of which is very trippy, and also very similar to Toy Story 3.
498
"Truly I think Disney's dead now" Go watch Tangled.
499
Really, do.
500
Maybe not up there with Disney's Renaissance period (Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Mermaid) but damn close.
501
I'm 22 and I rewatch Disney films all the time; Lion King is one of my all-time favourite movies.
502
Then again, I'm an animator, and I personally favour watching an animated film over a live-action one.
503
Also, you can be masculine and a fan of the eclectic, and still love Disney films.
504
Go rewatch Disney films now and you'll find that they carry an entirely new meaning.
505
For me, they've gotten better with age (the good ones, anyway)
506
Emperor's New Groove.
507
It is one of the most revered films of all time, and for good reason.
508
Aristocats, anybody?
509
I actually just rewatched The Sword in the Stone and The Black Cauldron this past week (I'm a professional film reviewer, but these were for fun).
510
Both have aged quite well and I look forward to watching them with my children.
511
My wife's favorite is Sleeping Beauty, which we just rewatched a few weeks ago together.
512
That movie still creeps me the fuck out.
513
I'm not a huge fan of it, but it is a really, really dark film.
514
I get what you're saying about Disney, but to me, my favorites will always be the ones that feel 'anti-Disney.'
515
I like Disney's darker period (The Black Cauldron, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, etc) and really enjoy revisiting a lot of their darker 80's films (Return to Oz, Night Crossing, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Watcher in the Woods, The Black Hole, etc).
516
I think there's still some modern 'anti-Disney' films out there -- Lilo and Stitch and The Emperor's New Groove come to mind -- but Disney has mostly parted ways with those directors/creators and have really let Pixar take the reigns.
517
Grown ass man, LOVE Disney films (plan on giving them as gifts for children's birthdays when I enter that stage of my life).
518
Here are my favorites: The 90s Golden Age: The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast.
519
OG Disney: Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White Old School: The Jungle Book, Robin Hood, The Sword and the Stone, The Fox and the Hound New School: Toy Story 1-3, Monster's Inc., The Incredibles, UP, Wall-E, Finding Nemo (really anything by Pixar) For People on Drugs: Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland, Dumbo
520
Just watched A Goofy Movie last night for the first time in over 10 years.
521
That was always a favorite of mine in elementary school -- I don't think it gets enough love!
522
So much respect for Goofy as a single dad ;)
523
Fantasia was always my favorite, but I also loved Snow White and Pinocchio.
524
And despite the horror stories of working conditions for Disney animators at the time, those films are some of the most lush and beautiful animations ever made.
525
Lion King and the Incredibles are some of my all time fav movies!
526
I just watched a large chunk of old Disney movies.
527
I liked 101 Dalmatians way more than when I was a kid, though the whole time I was thinking "get your animals altered.
528
If they don't spay or neuter this many freaking puppies there's going to be a world overrun with dalmatians!" Bambi I appreciated a lot more since going through film school with a lot of animation courses.
529
The main thing that sticks with me when watching Disney movies is how horrible their depictions of romance and gender are, as well as beauty standards and race.
530
(I wrote my thesis on this shit, so I've thought about it a lot).
531
I love Disney, own a bunch of their movies, and rewatch many times, but I can't help but be critical of everything except their animation.
532
And considering how prolific and GOOD Disney is and has been at making movies, I think they deserve to be watched for fun as well as with a critical eye.
533
Beyond the old classics, rewatching the Disney Renaissance films are well worth it.
534
You really get a good look at the formula they used to be so successful in that era.
535
Other than Disney, I rewatch all of the Bluth films on a regular basis.
536
Ima let you Lion King fans finish, but Aladdin was the greatest Disney movie of all time - Kanye Middle East
537
I always used to think that Aladdin was my favourite Disney movie, then, I re-watched Tarzan.
538
Now, its one of my all time favourite movies.
539
Robin Hood is my favourite Disney movie.
540
Close second is Beauty and the Beast.
541
Just watched hunchback of Notre Dame the other day.
542
YMMV, but it really is an unsung classic.
543
The animation is great, the characters are believable, and the villain song is mindblowing.
544
Definitely got more out of it this time than when I was a kid.
545
Snow White is still a classic without a doubt.
546
And I definitely agree with you on Peter Pan as well.
547
I love the music in Peter Pan so much that I can't help but feel nostalgic whenever I hear it in the film.
548
Definitely my favorite.
549
Lion King is easily one of the best movies of all time.
550
Classic story of revenge, great music, great voice-acting.
551
I love watching Disney classics.
552
I even watched Mary Poppins not too long ago (probably my favorite Disney movie as a kid).
553
They blended animation and live action in a way that hadn't been done before except for Bedknobs and Broomsticks, which is ANOTHER Disney movie.
554
I adore Sleeping Beauty.
555
It's a gorgeous film, shot in Technirama with backgrounds more intricate than any other Disney movie before it, and it's the last Disney movie that was inked entirely by hand.
556
The studio worked on it for a decade!
557
So many of the Disney fairytales follow the same formula, so what sets them apart are the aesthetic and characters.
558
Aurora is, in my opinion, the most beautiful princess, and Maleficent is untouchable as a villain.
559
When she summons all the powers of Hell to kill Prince Philip.I get goosebumps every time.
560
Are we including Disney-PIXAR?
561
Because they have a monopoly on my animated-family-film-spending as of right now.
562
It's not even close.
563
I've heard good things about some of the Dreamworks stuff, but there is a connection with the characters and an emotional resonance in Disney-PIXAR films that Dreamworks has never achieved for me.
564
UP did it 15 or so minutes into the film; Wall-E had me the instant I saw him playing with garbage; Toy Story 3 smacked me right in the emotional, inner child.
565
Disney-PIXAR films still have a good trend of magnificent films (and even the short animations before the main features); even though I thought Brave was mediocre, that little short before the film "La Luna" was adorable.
566
Also, Disney redistributes Miyazaki films, and while they may be entirely the product of Studio Ghibli, I'm pretty sure Disney is responsible for the dubbing process.
567
Why would watching a Disney movie make you less masculine?
568
Anyone who would put you down for that is someone you probably shouldn't hang out with.
569
In Junior year of highschool I took a class called "Myth Tales" where we'd watch a variety of movies, including Disney animated classics and read the stories that they're based on; the biggest example that comes to mind is reading certain parts of "Hamlet" and then watching "The Lion King", this scene was never the same for me.
570
It's weird what holds up and what doesn't, I found Aladdin really dull on re-watch, but it was one of my favourites as a kid.
571
After re-watching all or most of them: Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Lion King, Pinocchio and weirdly (never liked it as a kid) Hunchback of Notre Dame really are great movies, not just great kids' movies.
572
The Little Mermaid.
573
Get me just drunk enough and near a body of water: "I want to be, where the people are"
574
Cinderella.
575
Again and again and again.
576
The late 80s/early 90s renaissance films are worth a rewatch as well.
577
I watch Aladdin a lot and Mulan because I like singing the 'I'll make a man out of you' song.
578
Evidently you have neither children nor grandchildren.
579
Since I have five great-grandchildren, I've lost count how many times I've watched some of those great films.
580
Robin Williams and Aladdin are always entertaining, as is Bambi.
581
If we're throwing in Mulan, I'm throwing in Hercules.
582
And Atlantis, although it's already been said. .
583
Atlantis 2 was "meh."
584
I'm a very sentimental person, so the older I get the more I want to watch them.
585
Toy Story and Winnie the Pooh hold a very special place in my heart, but I still love Monsters Inc., Hunchback of Notre Dam, Beauty and the Beast, Hercules, and a Goofy Movie.
586
I know theres more, but I cant think of them all off the top of my head, but these are my absolute favorites.
587
Pinocchio, especially the beginning scenes with all the clocks, each one completely different, running on different rhythms and timings of events, all going off at once -- just the finest animation.
588
And then Geppetto has to check his adorable pocket watch just to be sure of the time.
589
It's a stunning movie.
590
Also, if you watch Snow White, pay attention to every little thing in the backgrounds and "sets."
591
The detail is breath-taking.
592
Leave me in awe, that's for sure.
593
The artwork in 101 Dalmatians (1961) is still beautiful.
594
Although, not really a classic.
595
Some of the magic is gone if you decide to re-watch them as a grown-up, but they're still very enjoyable and nostalgic, just not the "masterpieces" you once remembered them to be.
596
Perhaps not a "classic", but Emperor's New Groove is my favorite Disney movie, and that one still holds up and gets more hilarious every damn time.
597
Fantasia!
598
I loved that movie as a child and I saw it in a different way 20 years later.
599
I appreciated differents parts of the movie that I overlooked as a kid.
600
My wife is comforted by Disney movies and will often watch them to help her sleep.
601
They don't help me sleep.
602
I usually stay up, listening to them.
603
I know many Disney movies by heart.
604
Which isn't a bad thing.
605
Having kids has been the best thing that has happened to my movie nostalgia muscle, as I get to rediscover the things (and movies) that filled me with wonder when I was a child.
606
All the time.
607
Aladdin, Peter Pan, and Lion King were a few of my favorites.
608
I thought the recent Princess and the Frog and Tangled were excellent.
609
I feel no shame in admitting I like to watch my Disney movies at least once a week.
610
I love my collection of Disney VHS.
611
I rewatch Disney movies all the time (live action, classic animation, and computer animation).
612
If you're looking for a newer one, I really enjoyed Princess and the Frog.
613
Also, Aladdin is always a ton of fun.
614
Definitely worth rewatching as an adult.
615
Disney movies are always great to watch on chill nights with friends.
616
Seeing this makes me want to watch the jungle book
617
I always love watching Hercules and Lion King.
618
Two of my favorites!
619
The Little Mermaid and Lady and the Tramp
620
"Robin Hood and Little John were walkin' through the forest, laughin' back n' forth at what the other has to say."
621
58 years old here and I've been a sucker for animation and Disney since I saw Fantasia when I was 5. I was disappointed when my kids moved out and I lost my movie-theater buddies but got right back on that horse.
622
Do go see "Brave" if you haven't yet.
623
It has a good story, great voices, and is technically wonderful.
624
Don't forget non-Disney efforts.
625
I (and the kids) liked Titan A.E., Anastasia, and a few more Don Bluth (and other) films, too.
626
What has this all to do with my masculinity.
627
Disney classics are a great piece of nostalgia for a lot of us.
628
I remember Robin Hood, my favorite, and Aladdin.
629
I can still sing most of the Aladdin songs in french.
630
I also remember exactly where and on what rug we would watch it with my cousins at my grandma's.
631
Good times.
632
I am definitely gonna build a video archive for my children, grand-children, and their children.
633
Count on the Avatar serie, Dragonball, robinson crusoe, and many more.
634
As a classical musician, I of course have to rank Fantasia near the top of my list.
635
That shit is true art.
636
Aladdin and The Emporer's New Groove are freaking brilliant.
637
I rewatch them occasionaly.
638
My favorites growing up were The Sword in the Stone, Robin Hood and Alice in Wonderland.
639
Every once in a while I'll get an urge to revisit my childhood.
640
Yes, Sleeping Beauty and The Sword in the Stone are regulars of mine.
641
Also most shorts.
642
I love Disney's Ugly Duckling.
643
Actually just got done watching tangled.
644
I have a 4 yr old son and I'm rewatching all the oldies with him.
645
One of my favorite ones is The Lion king.
646
It has just held up over the years.
647
I have the whole slate of the classic-classics (pre 80's) and I watch them pretty often.
648
Alice in Wonderland is a hoot.
649
I think Bambi holds up as a fine film!
650
Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Sword in the Stone and Peter Pan are my favorites.
651
I watch them occasionally.
652
I will be showing them to my kids as they get older.
653
And I do agree that Tangled is great.
654
I may be looking at it through the filter of childhood, but I still have a soft spot for Pete's Dragon.
655
lol since when does masculinity have anything to do with enjoying a well-made film?
656
Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney film!
657
It's absolutely gorgeous to watch.
658
The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and The Lion King.
659
One of the really early ones from my childhood was Peter and the Wolf.
660
It's only 15 minutes long, but it's a really nice story, and it has Prokofiev's music in the background.
661
I have re-watched some of the old Disney movies, yes, my favorite one is most definitely The Fox and the Hound.
662
tarzan
663
Have kids.
664
must watch
665
THE SWORD AND THE STONE!
666
I love this movie more than life itself
667
Watch them with my wife all the Time, its amazing to see the difference In those.kids
668
movies and the ones today, the amount of large words and education in them compared to the bull shit kids watch now days, such are Dora the explorer, " can u find snookie" " yell snookie if u find snookie" just goes to show how modern tv is brainwashing children to be dumb
669
Gotta love Aladdin!
670
Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and Fantasia.
671
I've watched all of those multiple times since they came out.
672
I even went to see the first two in theaters when they were re-released recently.
673
if you want to rewatch the old disney classics, watch them on bluray.
674
most of the good ones are out on bluray by now and they look amazing.
675
I recently re watched all of the movies that I loved as a child just for the nostalgia.
676
I'll make sure when I have kids that they too get to see the same things that made my childhood great.
677
"The Walt Disney Company bought Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion, which transaction made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder.".
678
Rescuers Down Under, Lady and the Tramp, The Fox and The Hound, Sword In the Stone.
679
I fucking love The Lion King
680
Some time time when I am on you tube the related videos lead me to disney movies.
681
:P Or I just ask my baby nephew if he wants to watch something.
682
Dumbo is my favorite.
683
The Pink Elephants segment warped my psyche in ways I don't think I've ever gotten over.
684
Emperor's New Groove and Beauty & the Beast.
685
Also, Mulan, but mainly for its soundtrack.
686
Anybody who doesn't still watch Disney movies into adulthood is either a terrorist or a closeted homosexual in furious denial.
687
The Rescuers Down Under.
688
What does security with your manhood have to do with disney?
689
Those movies were great
690
The Black Cauldron is seriously under-rated in my opinion, and hella scary
691
I was at my friend's birthday party when his mom said we were going to see Tangled.
692
No one wanted to go because what 11 year old boys want to go see Tangled.
693
We all went in with very low excpectations and left with a rejuvanated love for Disney.
694
I had my entire high school AP chemistry class singing songs from Mulan, Aladdin, Lion King, and Jungle Book one day.
695
Then the principle came in and said he was a big fan but we needed to keep it down.
696
I babysat my 3 1/2 year old Niece the other day and we watched Beauty and the Beast.
697
IT WAS AWESOME.
698
I'm a 22 year old guy and I was loving it.
699
I won't let her watch the Rescuers Down Under, that one is just too scary.
700
The thing is that I see this post after a few friends and I had a downright manly Disney movie marathon.
701
Because we're just bad asses like that.
702
Robin hood is one of my all time favorites.
703
The opening song is the best!
704
I fucking love Robin Hood.
705
One of the greatest Disney movies ever.
706
The Sword in the Stone.
707
My favorite pre 90s Disney movie.
708
I always feel like it goes unnoticed.
709
Fievel goes West and Land Before Time .BITCHES!
710
but I'm not sure if they are Disney.
711
Treasure Planet!
712
One of the most underrated Disney movies.
713
If you haven't seen it, watch it.
714
It's awesome!
715
I'm a huge Disney NUT.
716
I've seen them all (though crappy sequels don't count).
717
Beauty and the Beast for me.
718
OP--Ever read about what happened to the voice actor for Peter Pan?
719
Recently re-watched a ton of Disney movies with my friends a little before graduation.
720
They all still blew my mind.
721
Love: Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Sword and the Stone and Dumbo.
722
No, those movies scare me way too much.
723
The jungle book, hands down
724
Lion King and Alladin.
725
I might have to put them on my netflix que.
726
I cried like a bitch during The Lion King last week.
727
I do rewatch the classics, not all of them, the older ones are from a different time when everything moved at snailpace, but Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin remain some of my all-time favourite movies.
728
The most powerful, and in many ways most depressing movie of all time is Requiem For A Dream.
729
Ohhhhh my god.
730
I'm downvoting this not because of anything you did in particular, but because of the fact that this is going to happen.
731
Ughhhhhh
732
I'm Down
733
Great movie!
734
Sadly, the sequel in (forgot exact name, but it happens in Rio de Janeiro) is not as good.
735
Starship Troopers.
736
The Bubble Boy is my favorite, but I don't know anyone else that likes it.
737
Pooty tang.
738
The Core: It's mostly the cast that makes the movie enjoyable for me.
739
Plus it ends with a 30 Seconds to Mars track Ignore the technicalities and enjoy it.
740
The Ninth Gate: I'm the only one I know who likes this film.
741
There are several others similar to this that I also like: End of Days; Stigmata The Weather Man: This is a beautiful movie with plenty of great moments.
742
There are plenty of people who are critical of Caine's accent but I didn't mind.
743
I love Ready To Rumble with David Arquette, Scott Cann, and Oliver Platt
744
Cable Guy.
745
Might be the most re-watchable Jim Carrey movie for me.
746
"Steven it's only skin."
747
The Star Wars prequels.
748
Behind Enemy Lines
749
Escape from New York.
750
Cloverfield, I loved that shit.
751
My friends are cunts.
752
Arthur.
753
I've had a boner for Russel Brand ever since his podcast got cancelled.
754
National Treasure 1/2, Indiana Jones 4.
755
Bio-Dome for sure.
756
It 5% on rotten tomatoes and every one apparently hates pauly shore.
757
I find that it only gets better with age.
758
VIVA LOS BIO DOME!
759
Pretty much any Pauly Shore movie.
760
His movies do terrible on IMDB but I enjoy them all, I believe it's mostly a nostalgic thing when my brother and I use to always watch his movies together.
761
We don't talk much anymore but when we do we usually quote movies we grew up watching together.
762
If I had to choose one, it'd be Bio-Dome.
763
4/10 on IMDB and 1/100 IMDB critics but I love it.
764
squirrely!
765
The Santa Clause
766
Alpha Dog, because of Justin Timberlake
767
Mars Attacks.
768
Jurassic Park 2 - (The lost world, Jurassic Park), and to a lesser extent Jurassic Park 3. Dinosaurs are awesome.
769
Armageddon.
770
It's a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.
771
The human centipede.
772
Best romantic comedy of the year.
773
Nacho Libre and Gentleman Broncos
774
Good Burger
775
every time a thread like this comes up, people name movies that they damn well know (or fucking should) are not "generally disliked."
776
O.M.G. every1 els h8s this kvlt movie with a gigantic following WHY AM I SO WIERD LOL having said that, everyone else seems to hate it, but Citizen Kane
777
The 2nd and 3rd Matrix films.
778
Also, people don't like The Day After Tomorrow?
779
I love that movie!
780
tron legacy
781
John Carter
782
I really liked The Butterfly Effect.
783
Sure it may have had a plot hole half the way through but I still found it quite enjoyable.
784
Returner - Pretty cool action/sci-fi flick with decent CGI.
785
The Neighbor Number 13 - A psych-thriller, but I couldn't help but throw it in.
786
House of Fury - A light-hearted action/comedy.
787
The problem is, we have no fucking reason to ever fear the North Koreans as a Military presence (as Americans of course).
788
But the Russians back in the day.that is a whole new enemy and a lot more to fear.
789
Chris Hemsworth, Josh Pence, and the guy who played Peeta in The Hunger Games?
790
Sure, I'm game.
791
It looks silly but, meh, if it was deadly serious it would be boring.
792
Murphy's Romance.
793
Million Dollar Baby.
794
The saddest part was not even the paralysis, it is the family that treats her horribly.
795
Please ensure that your comment on an r/science thread is: not a joke, meme, or off-topic.
796
These are not acceptable as top-level comments and will be removed.
797
There's a couple clips in Black Swan spoilers Pi The entire last act of Requiem for a Dream starting when There is something about Aronofsky films that really get under my skin.
798
If he wasn't such a good director, I would stop watching his films.
799
I've tried taking this quote to heart: "because she likes the same bizzaro crap you do doesn't mean she's your soul mate" from 500 Days of Summer.
800
I guess I would also take that in the other direction, if she doesn't like the same shit you do doesn't mean you aren't compatible.
801
Click on link, "is Jennifer Lawrence in it?"
802
yes, she is.
803
Now, I'm with you OP.
804
Jennifer Lawrence is a great, very natural actor.
805
She's intrigued me since Winter's Bone.
806
Also, Fassbender is one of the best actors currently working.
807
Also, I loved First Class.
808
The Social Network score.
809
Not many mainstream films have used such ambient electronica as scores.
810
It's very original.
811
Also, I'm really hoping that scoring becomes a thing of the past.
812
Think of the dramatic tension of No Country for Old Men or the TV show Breaking Bad.
813
Think of the maddening suspense of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity.
814
Think of the physical brutality of the sewer scene in TDKR.
815
What do they all have in common?
816
Completely diagetic sound.
817
Non-diagetic sounds distracts and destroys tension.
818
Why haven't there been classic scores recently?
819
Because movies are rightfully moving away from scores in general.
820
That has to be a long time into the future though.
821
There has to be: A stable Superman (maybe Snyder's will work?
822
It has promise) A new Batman (which no one is going to touch for years) Probably a new Green Lantern (I guess they could use Reynolds but I'm guessing they want to forget about that movie as much as the rest of us) A Wonder Woman (which has been in development hell for a decade and Whedon probably doesn't want to or can't do it anymore) Why don't they just keep doing the animated stuff?
823
Justice League Doom was pretty awesome.
824
I've never used an IRC room for other subreddits, but probably if you make it (and tell the mods so they can put it in the sidebar) they will come.
825
I'd drop in when I have nothing better to do.
826
Not out yet but I started sobbing during the trailer for Les Miserables so I'm going to go ahead and say it's probably going to be one of the saddest movies ever.
827
But, I'm a huge fan of the musical so I have a near-Pavlovian response to the music.
828
Some people overthink horror movies.
829
I saw it with a bunch of friends (all of us film majors), I had smoked a little earlier in the night and was a little high for the whole thing (just enough so my critical facilities were gone).
830
I got really into it.
831
I remember the scene really got to me.
832
I was really into the atmosphere and the jump scares and everything.
833
But after the movie, all my (sober) friends were talking about the plot holes and how this and that were frustrating.
834
I don't remember specifics though.
835
I guess people didn't like it for the same reason a lot of people don't like Prometheus, the plot was really hole-y and character motivations were off.
836
That's just my two cents.
837
The Cabin in the Woods.
838
After watching the trailer I remember thinking it looked stupid but after seeing the good reviews I thought I'd give it a shot.
839
I found it to be both funny and exciting.
840
A great satire, and a great surprise.
841
I was sold on the movie as soon as the title showed up (two people are talking and it's very calm followed by an out of place loud noise, the title, and a hilarious jump scare).
842
It's just an absolute blast and whether or not you're a fan or horror (I'm usually not) I'd highly recommend it.
843
Edit: Also 21 Jump Street.
844
Not normally my type of movie but I really enjoyed it.
845
I put a lot of focus on directors so that would explain where my interests lie.
846
Attack the Block, Drive and Intouchables.
847
Heard good things, but I was not prepared for the awesomness that was Attack the Block and Drive.
848
Nor the man tears I shed for Intouchables.
849
When I saw Click I was expecting another stupid Adam Sandler comedy.
850
It was not a comedy, despite all advertising and the assumptions that come with a generally typecast actor in the lead role.
851
Made the whole movie just that much more effective, I guess.
852
Triangle http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064/
853
Had no Idea what this was when I first started watching it and it started off so slow I only kept watching since nothing was on.
854
By the time it was over my mind was blown.
855
25th hour - this is now one of my favourite films.
856
Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
857
I went into it thinking it'd be bad, but in the end I was completely blown away.
858
Funny People
859
Whale Rider.
860
DESTROYED me.
861
Incredible film.
862
Didn't expect that at all.
863
I was expecting something surfacey like Free Willy or something.
864
Braindead.
865
Reluctant at first, I was expecting a gory/creepy flick and it turned out hilarious.
866
Gentleman Broncos
867
American dreams.
868
Pretty funny stuff
869
Law Abiding Citizen.
870
One of my friends mentioned it and I decided to give it a chance.
871
I figured it would be a typical action movie, but it turned out to be much more complex, and absolutely brilliant.
872
The 5th Element.
873
I went in expecting a highbrow scifi, or at the least a space opera, and instead got a hilarious comedy.
874
The Perfect Host.
875
I was delightfully surprised by the direction the movie took.
876
Arthur, Paranorman, Chronicle.
877
Both Arthur and Paranorman ended up being way better than I thought they would be.
878
Paranorman was actually pretty dark and even scary at parts.
879
I had no idea what Chronicle was about and by the end my jaw was on the floor.
880
Not to mention floaty cameras.
881
Thought that was pretty cool.
882
The Polar Express.
883
I was stocking up on Christmas DVDs for my children the year it came out, and I bought it sight unseen.
884
I put it in the DVD player for the kids to watch while my wife and I wrapped presents or something; I had no intention of watching it with them at that time and I ended up glued to the TV the whole time.
885
I know it isn't universally loved, but it ended up being one of my all-time favorites.
886
The Grey.
887
I was expecting a stupid fun Liam Neeson boxes wolves film boy was I wrong (In a good way).
888
The 8 minute rape scene in Irreversible.
889
It's even more crazy once you know that the director is also Monica Bellucci's husband.
890
He had to sit there.
891
Behind the camera.
892
And watch it.
893
wtf.
894
For those interested NSFW obviously:Here is the scene
895
Hudson Hawk.
896
Course you could argue that leverage has this covered.
897
Miller's Crossing.
898
I know it's not a detective film per se but it sure has that feel to it.
899
A Simple Curve.
900
Classic hippie movie.
901
Or at least classic if you were raised by hippies.
902
Right at the end of The Prestige when there's a flashback to Spoiler
903
The 2000-era live action Dungeons and Dragons.
904
It was so painful to watch.
905
Now that Harry Potter has shown how to do it, they could make something a lot better.
906
Starship Troopers 2. I loved the first one so watching that piece of shit really killed me.
907
I really enjoyed it.
908
It is the best Navy Seal movie that has been made thus far
909
What kind of ignorant, perverted troglodyte calls rape, torture, and genocide "decent nsfw"?
910
I'd love a good remake of Coalminer's Daughter.
911
Sissy Spacek was incredible, but it's a film that could be absolutely fantastic with a good tune-up.
912
I'm a chick, and I always shut myself in with brutal action films when going through a breakup.
913
My girlfriends have a tendency to want to watch The Notebook and Titanic and that kind of shit, but I really prefer watching people get blown to bits.
914
If the lead is a chick who kills a lot of people in cold blood, even better.
915
Avatar: The Last Airbender.
916
It could have been amazing.
917
There's a lot of love for science fiction, but what about The Warriors?
918
Heavy Metal.
919
Not so much a remake as just a new anthology of stories using today's animation technology.
920
Was sad when Fincher's version got tanked, so I'm hoping Rodriguez's version goes somewhere.
921
Krull.
922
This could be awesome if they downplayed the elements ripped off from Star Wars and updated the aesthetic of it.
923
Shit, they did it with Battlestar Galactica, so why not?
924
The Last Starfighter.
925
I could totally see this working, as long as they invested due care and attention in the inevitable tie-in video game.
926
Logan's Run.
927
Because wow that movie is dated.
928
A Refn/Gosling remake is supposedly in the works, which I could totally get behind, but who knows if that's anything more than talk at this point.
929
The Monster Squad.
930
There is movement on a remake already, but it'll probably suck as it looks to be under the Platinum Dunes banner.
931
Night of the Creeps.
932
Also incredibly dated.
933
Could be a lot of fun with the right director and writer.
934
Spawn
935
It
936
I am firmly on the fence about ROBOCOP.
937
I Know it's going to happen, but I still think it holds up and the only major weak point are the special effects, CGI has come MILES in years to making 50 foot transformers look believable on screen.
938
That said I don't think the dialogue is bad, the characters were great, Peter Weller NAILED IT, Ronny Cox and (RED FORMAN-LOL) did Great, and the story was very compelling in the Origin movie.
939
II was ok and I could have lived just fine without III.
940
My point is I really hope they don't dumb down the story, character emotions, and cast a believable bunch.
941
I personally thing the RoboCop world has a lot more to lose than to gain if they don't pull it off smooth fingers crossed^ With all the crap being remade (Rebooted-TOO SOON!)(Spider Man, Hulk etc.) or unnecessarily (Total Recall, ad infinitum) I was thinking how sweet it would be to reboot the DEATHWISH franchise It starts out as a perfect underdog/victim movie that tracks the progression of a reluctant hero, becoming the ever more violent super badass through the series fighting for neighbors, friends, and his own growing desire for justice, street style.
942
I love Bronson, and he was perfect, but it's 30 years later and with some script updates and proper selection of lead actor, I think it could work.
943
Still one of MY FAVORITE seres', but getting a little dated.
944
Hackers.
945
A live action remake of Cowboy Bebop would be incredible.
946
Eragon!
947
Brave New World, 1984, Catch-22, All Quiet on the Western Front, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds (set in Victorian England, as it should), The Neverending Story, Logan's Run, Barbarella, 20000 Leagues under the sea, Ivanhoe
948
Little Shop of Horrors
949
Sphere, I know Cracked mentioned this, but i love the premise of a ship from the future being found in an archeological sense.
950
Network Update it to cable news.
951
Star Wars series.
952
Lucas has already done enough perversion and meddling.
953
Might as well give that universe a fresh start, with hopefully talented, passionate people involved.
954
No question: Messiah of Evil!
955
I've been thinking that Fantastic Voyage is prime and ready for a remake.
956
So in conclusion: no movie should ever be remade, it almost always dissapoints
957
Waterloo (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066549/),
958
1970, starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon and Christopher Plummer as Wellington.
959
Possibly the best war movie you have never seen.
960
It is a movie with epic - and historically accurate - battle scenes.
961
It should put to rest forever the canard of French cowardice, especially one of the last scenes when the Imperial Guard chooses to die to a man rather than surrender.
962
Using literally 10,000s of soldiers dressed up on period uniforms and period weapons, this pre-CGI epic needs to be remade with modern technology.
963
i may be alone on this one, but i thought the concept of "In Time" was brilliant but the acting and well pretty much everything but the idea was pretty terrible.
964
It couldve or could be an amazing movie if it was done well.
965
I read an article recently that brought up a good point: Every studio remakes successful movies - i.e. movies that were popular, critically praised, or both.
966
Yet no one wants to try and remake an unsuccessful movie.
967
From a business standpoint I can see why.
968
But I still think it'd be awesome to take a box office failure from the past and make a serious attempt to remake it into a success.
969
For example: Krull.
970
I loved that movie as a kid.
971
The high fantasy premise, if done right, could appeal to both adults and children, men and women, so you've got mass audience appeal.
972
And the glaive is a fuckin' awesome weapon with a distinct look.
973
Give that movie to a director and writers who understand fantasy, and I can see it being both fun and profitable.
974
Westworld
975
Any and all of the Star Wars movies.
976
The Star Wars universe has so much more potential than the shit that George Lucas was able to churn out from it.
977
Go play the game "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" or it's sequel to see what great storytellers can do with Star Wars.
978
Knights of the Old Republic has a better plot and characters than any of the movies.
979
Cube I think it's awesome, personally, but if there were a version done now with a bigger budget and more care, it could be one of the best horror movies yet.
980
Vincenzo Natali has gained some fame since Splice, and maybe after Neuromancer is complete he could return to do Cube again.
981
I think papillon would make for a great re-make.
982
Have adrian brody in place of dustin hoffman, and brad pitt in place of steve mcqueen.
983
It would have to be a respectful remake, one which adds to the movie, not just some special effects pos.
984
Not sure, though, as the movie has that patina that cannot be re-done.
985
Actually that's the appeal of the movie for me.
986
that worn out old classic movie look.
987
It would have to be shot in 70mm also this
988
All Quiet on the Western Front.
989
nineteen eighty four - This is sorely needed.
990
Done a la "Children of Men"
991
Alien 3 - great premise.
992
Remake wouldn't have to be part of the franchise.
993
Guyver - make it a movie about a man who is obliged to lose his humanity to alien technology.
994
They Live.
995
The Hunger Games.
996
The movie was complete shit.
997
I didnt like it at all.
998
They hyped it up to be one of the biggest movies of the year.
999
I was disappointed.
1000
Planet of the Vampires Queen of Blood They are horribly cheesy movies from the 60s, but the ideas are interesting and they would be awesome in a proper dark/psychological horror setting.
1001
In fact, elements from those two movies inspired the first Alien.
1002
I would love to see a true to the book version of Spaceship Troopers.
1003
The movie they did make is so awful and different that it shouldn't even be allowed to share the same name as the book.
1004
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
1005
I wanted so badly to like it.
1006
I tried to like it, I really did.
1007
They cast actors I love, they had some nice visual tuff going on, and they had such charming source material to work with.
1008
But they went and fucked it up.
1009
They needlessly changed the story, actually reducing their ability to make a sequel, and made everything very safe and tame.
1010
It needed more quirk, more emotion.
1011
It felt like they were just going through the motions, doing not much more than the bare minimum to get by.
1012
Too safe.
1013
Too Americanized.
1014
In the end I think half the charm of Douglas Adams' work is in the wording and the telling of the story - stuff that doesn't translate to screen.
1015
But it would be nice to see it done at least as right as is possible.
1016
Remember that dark and ambitious 90's movie classic, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
1017
I think that they could do a great remake of it if the script was put into the right hands.
1018
You know, somebody like George Lucus or even better, Michael Bay!
1019
I'd like to see a good remake of 12 Monkeys.
1020
Metropolis.
1021
Next, or a movie closer to the original story.
1022
The movie got some of it right as far as the protagonist being able to see all possible futures from any given action, but the book really made you feel what it would be like to have that kind of perception.
1023
If I remember correctly, it was presented almost like an infinitely huge wall of monitors in his mind, showing possible outcomes.
1024
Selecting one would lead him to another infinitely huge wall of monitors.
1025
But he wasn't just selecting one at a time - he was exploring every possible outcome simultaneously, like some sort of 4th dimensional neurological system in his own brain.
1026
It resulted in you as the reader (or audience member) being almost afraid of him.
1027
Spider-Man! Again!LOL
1028
Very recent, but I think Hunger Games could have been so much better.
1029
I'd kill to have Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men) make the remake.
1030
Edit: Why downvotes: Disagree?
1031
The Gluttony scene in Seven That one still freaks me out
1032
I think WB needs to focus on not fucking up Superman first.
1033
then unfucking up Green Lantern, then give us a new Batman, then think about JLA.

Jesus Christ Superstar

For me, it is already a tired franchise.
1042
I don't have any patience anymore to see "new" convolutions involving killer robots and time travel.
1043
OK, you asked for it!
1044
Watch anything done by Lars von Trier.
1045
Start with Dogville and then see if you're in the mood for more.
1046
Could you let me know if you find this movie, I am now interested as well.
1047
Is there a site or something like that where you can download high res scenes from movies?
1048

1050
Curb stomp in American History X

Hayden Christensen trying to smooth talk Natalie Portman in Attack of the Clones.
1052
The hobbling scene in Misery.
1053
Just seeing the plank of wood between his feet and the hammer start to come down is enough to make me look away.
1054
I can't believe nobody has said the scene where James Franco Spoiler in 127 Hours.
1055
I've had to look away every time I've watched it.
1056

1061
Pet Sematary, this bitch eating her fucking soup.
1062
When I was younger (10ish) the scene in Saving Private Ryan where the German soldier slowly stabs the American in the heart use to make me cringe to the point I had to look away.
1063
To this day that scene still makes me cringe.
1064
I know it's not a movie but this fucking scene from a Spongebob episode
1065
i can't believe nobody has mentioned Meet the Parents.
1066
Every single scene in that movie makes me cringe.
1067
Volleyball?
1068
Toilet?
1069
Burning down the altar?
1070
And when they finally converge on Stiller for spray painting a cat?
1071
Fuck that movie is uncomfortable.

1079
When Tom Cruise is about to have his eyeballs removed in 'Minority Report' comes to mind.
1080
(Also the short eyeball virus shot in 'Prometheus'.)
1081
Also it should be noted I watched John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' once, and I won't ever watch that movie again.
1082
This isint as hardcore as all the other suggestions , but that scene in The Parent Trap, when lindsay lohans character is piercing her twins sisters ear with nothing more than a hot needle, an ice cube and an apple.
1083
Definitely Antichrist, where Charlotte Gainsbourg's character crushes Willem Dafoe's testicles, then proceeds to jack him off until he comes blood.
1084
If you don't shudder at that, you're sick.
1085
When private mellish gets stabbed in saving private ryan.
1086
The ending of Oldboy literally caused me physical pain.
1087
I dropped my jaw so hard that it hurt, and that particular bit had me screaming silently at the screen as the scene played, something like "nooo no no noooo."
1088
I had never cringed so hard at a movie .
1089
I can't imagine what it will be like watching it for the second time, knowing the ending.
1090
The torture scene in Audition.
1091
Murder scene from 'Heavenly Creatures'
1092
Martyrs, anyone?

I just can't stand vomit at all.
1097
Requiem for a Dream Spoiler
1098
The last minutes of Requiem for a Dream.
1099
God that movie is so sad I can't stand it.
1100
The clips of the mother freak me out the most
1101
Zombi 2 Skip to 3:00.
1102
I took the OP's post title to mean uncomfortable and awkward, like a Larry David scene from Curb Your Enthusiasm that just makes your skin crawl.
1103
That being said, the scene that absolutely makes me cringe the most of any movie is in Swingers when Mikey keeps calling the girl and getting her answering machine.
1104
Honestly, I've fast forwarded through the scene once or twice because it just makes me so uncomfortable.
1105
District 9. when Wikus van de Merwe starts to grow the prawn arm and he is in the government lab.
1106
I feel it is so realistic and capable of happening that it scares the hell out of me.
1107
Arm cutting scene in 127 hours.
1108
Simply cannot ever watch that movie again.
1109
Black Hawk Down.
1110
Guy gets blown in half.
1111
The ending of Buried.
1112
Clerks when Caitlin fucked the old guy's corpse.
1113
Most definitely cringe worthy.
1114
There's the scene in Hellraiser (or could it be the second one) when they are carrying something upstairs and he scrapes the skin off the back of his hand on a nail.
1115
There's so much more gore in that movie, but that bit is the part I can't stand.
1116
Damn near every scene in Funny Games Such a bizarre and warped movie, how I love it.
1117
I don't have a specific scene but any time a character makes an ass of themselves I cannot stand to watch, no problem with gore though.
1118
That scene in one of the later Harry Potter movies where Harry and Hermione start dancing in that big old tent always makes me cringe.
1119
But then it goes on and it's actually rather sweet.
1120
But still makes me cringe just thinking about the beginning.
1121
Erk!
1122
the Matthew Patel song scene in Scott Pilgrim, its gross.
1123
I'm not fond of the blow torch to face scene in Hostel, the film sucks anywhere but I generally hated that scene.
1124
the rape scene in A Clockwork Orange
1125
The whole of "A Serbian Film".
1126
Newborn porn, teeth being took out, necrophilia.
1127
Pick your twisted depraved fantasy.
1128
the scene in batman forever where bruce wayne is asking out dr. chase meridian and he says, "tell me doctor, do you enjoy the circus?"
1129
except for some reason he says "circus" with a lisp.
1130
it's awful and hard to watch.
1131
did they not realize he was saying that word really strangely?
1132
here's the clip.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0OFoi4Y2GM
1133
Reservoir Dogs.
1134
because someone did an hour before you
1135
when harry met sally!
1136
it's awesome
1137
I recommend Brick.
1138
While set in a high school, it's dripping with pulpish noir.
1139
You won't regret it.
1140
Seven, not because it is a masterful film but because of the absolute shock and horror ten year old me experienced during the last 15 minutes of the film.
1141
I really enjoy how Firefly hinted at being in the same universe as the Alien franchise by having the Weyland-Yutani logo appear several times throughout the show.
1142
I've also read that there's an Alien/Buffy comic out there somewhere in the ether.
1143
A fanboy could only dream of Alien, Firefly, and Buffy existing in the same universe.
1144
Are you kidding me?
1145
Have you seen ANY of the Lord of the Rings movies?
1146
I would recommend "The Usual Suspects"
1147
Taegukgi (The Brotherhood Of War) has got such a sad ending, man tears were nearly shed.
1148
A Knights Tale or 10 Things I Hate About You, love the both, and so easy to watch.
1149
mean streets (dir.
1150
martin scorsese) harvey is the main character although robert de niro almost outshines him in a supporting role.
1151
It isn't the worst film I've seen, however I don't think they've made a decent film in years.
1152
I'd hate to see a JLA film flop as I'm a huge DC fan and I would like it to be a successful franchise.
1153
Go watch Speed Racer and then tell me you still think it will be awesome.
1154
So im assuming this will be a standalone film?
1155
No way they are getting christian bales batman in this, also we have ryan reynolds green lantern and the dude playing the new superman.
1156
If they are going with an ensemble cast i cant see the movie being that popular
1157
I want to see Smashed, the cast is too intriguing to pass up and I normally don't go for festival movies but this one I keep hearing good things about it yet see nothing from it.
1158
So the mystery has me.
1159
Branded had an awesome trailer.
1160
It seems interesting.
1161
Lincoln, Gravity and Life of Pi are winter releases but would like more info on them.
1162
That should be it.
1163
The Hobbit.
1164
That is all.
1165
I've seen a few times and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1166
It was extremely claustrophobic and well played.
1167
On scale however, it's a 7.
1168
Not great, definitely not bad, yet not something that stands out as classic.
1169
You won't believe this, I can't believe this, try Star Wars and Star Trek.
1170
Thank J.J. Abrams for including R2D2 as debris during Nero's attack of Vulcan.
1171
I'm not sure what you mean by "older" and don't have the energy to check the films you list.
1172
Try these:.
1173
It's Complicated (2009, Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin) Terms of Endearment (1983, Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger (young), Jack Nicholson) GREAT movie.
1174
The "older" part is a subplot but it's a good one.
1175
Must Love Dogs (2005, Diane Lane, John Cusack) Not old, per se, but old by normal Hollywood standards
1176
Playing by Heart has multiple storylines, one of which revolve around an older couple.
1177

Ip Man Vengeance trilogy Hero is one of my favs.
1183
Ip Man
1184
Fearless with Jet Li is awesome too.
1185
Ong Bak is pretty nice, although the later ones get kind of weird.
1186
But I liked the first one.
1187
Ajussi is my favourite though, it is AWESOME
1188
Kung fu hustle
1189
Crows Zero 1 & 2 and The Vengeance Trilogy (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance)
1190
Zatoichi
1191
Acquire any movie with Donnie Yen in it and enjoy.
1192
SPL was a donnie yen movie that always stuck with me that noone talks about
1193
John Woo: The Killer Hard Boiled Shephen Show: Shaolin Soccer Kung Fu Hustle Others: Infernal Affairs I Saw the Devil the Police Story and Drunken Fighter series - or pretty much any Jackie Chan movies
1194
Ajussi should be on this list.
1195
Well no and yet yes.
1196
If she is into mainstream lame movies such as Twillight, and hates movies as fight club then I can't imagine us being together.

10 things i hate about you.

'Edward Scissor-hands' no other film has made me tear up like that.
1199
HE JUST MISSES HIS DAD, HE WANTS TO BE LOVED
1200
I'm not as well versed in South Korean cinema as I'd like but even so, choosing six must watch is really difficult.
1201
Anything by Park Chan Wook seems to be a given, but I really enjoyed My Wife is a Gangster and The Chaser not to mention City of Violence
1202
A Tale of Two Sisters, My Sassy Girl, A Bittersweet Life, Failan, Memories of Murder - some of my favourites.
1203
Love Korean cinema.
1204
The Host is my favorite monster movie.
1205
Godzilla can suck it.
1206
No "Thirst"?
1207
Tae Guk Gi will make you cry.
1208
It's an amazing movie no matter what category you put it in.
1209
Old Boy is, of course, legendary and if you haven't seen it you should feel bad.
1210
Daniel Henney is a nice guy IRL.
1211
Can't say I'm ever going to watch that chick flick though.
1212
The Host is a good monster flick.
1213
Worth a watch.
1214
Don't know anything about the other ones.
1215
"I saw the devil" is clearly missing in my opinion.
1216
Brilliant disturbing movie!
1217
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/
1218
Thanks for the feedback here - I wrote the post and tried to include a variety of different genres, and it was really difficult to come up with six that cover a broad category.
1219
This is by no means meant to be a definitive list of the best of Korean cinema by any means, just six movies that I enjoyed and would recommend to other people.
1220
As for the others mentioned here, I've seen some but not others, so more to check out.
1221
Thanks :)
1222
The director of The Chaser's second movie will be available on netflix instant starting on 8/28, it is called The Yellow Sea.
1223
Can't wait to check it out.
1224
I've been slowly posting about Korean movies in my site, it's badly written, but has many movies that are as "Unmissable" as the ones in this article.
1225
There's All Movies section that can keep you busy for a few evenings with good Korean cinema, many obvious choices and many not so known :)
1226
This one is also unmissable: Silenced Based on a true story, Silenced is a tragic and angry indictment of the South Korean judicial system.
1227
I didn't get into The Host the first time I saw it.
1228
I couldn't see what the big deal was.
1229
I'll try again someday.
1230
Everybody watch City of Violence!
1231
Not a single Jee-woon Kim film?
1232
No Mercy for the Rude is amazing, and I'm so upset that they missed it out.
1233
Does she mind foreign movies?
1234
My Sassy Girl.
1235
I'm a guy (yeah my balls are on the line here) who hates rom/coms and this instantly became one of my favourite movies.
1236
They need to establish some superheroes before going full out team up.
1237
Do a Flash and Wonder Woman movie, THEN get onto Justice League.
1238
I don't see how this is so hard, Warner Brothers own all of DC comics, it's not like Marvel with properties floating around in other base camps.
1239
so refreshing to see Hugh Laurie in a role that isn't House
1240
I distinctly remember an episode of House where Leighton Meester played a 17 year old who hits on House.
1241
Small world?
1242
Will probably see this for Alia's freckles and cynicism.
1243
Looks interesting.
1244
It's got a great cast from what I can tell and hopefully they can make it a solid movie.
1245
Winner of the 2012 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, A Separation
1246
I do not want a JL movie.
1247
Batman and Superman simply shouldn't exist in the same universe.
1248
It was a stunt to sell more comics, and it should be left at that.
1249
No, because that would be fucking retarded.
1250
YES, actually.
1251
We both studied film, but she pursued it to the graduate level, focusing heavily on horror.
1252
I'm indifferent to horror as a genre, but she was always going to see every new horror flick, buying as many obscure and rare VHS's as she could.
1253
I was fine with it, but as our relationship progressed and her true sado-masochistic self-abusing victim-complex craziness started unveiling itself she (while drunk fucking) told me how she gets off thinking about being stabbed and beaten and raped, that horror is her porn.
1254
Whatever floats your boat, you nutty broad, but don't stalk me when I politely decline to tie you up before sex.
1255
I wouldn't be with her for that long without getting to know her a little bit.
1256
but no, I would not.
1257
qualities have the strange power to compensate for defects - "bad taste, but in a funny sexy way" ps.
1258
not a question about movies
1259
I had a girlfriend a few years ago that thought the director of my favorite movie was a complete asshole.
1260
(As in - she's met him, and didn't like him.)
1261
Didn't matter.
1262
(Of course, she has a phd and occasionally teaches film at the local university.
1263
if we had a major disagreement about a movie, it's unlikely that I would be right.)
1264
When I was in college, my gf dragged me to see Cruel Intentions.
1265
While it was playing, I couldn't wait to talk afterwards about how bad the film was.
1266
Instead, on the car ride home, she proceeded to tell me why she loved it so much.
1267
I knew at that moment that it was time to end it.
1268
artsy detective stories?
1269
I can only recommend what I consider to be just about the best noir movie there is: kiss me deadly.
1270
he dies, the easy riders die they're the unsung unknown heroes of thier era. a man alone cannot escape his tragic destiny and stuff
1271
Captain Milkshake Hair
1272
Don't forget bank Gothic and the Spiderman font.
1273
I'm a bit worried about the time travel elements of the story, but other than that it sounds like good material.
1274
When he is watching TV or in the office?
1275
Kinda figured he'd have contention for Daredevil.
1276
Hopefully the Marvel reboot will be more impressive.
1277
Sentinels!
1278
Fucking sentinels, I'm so fucking excited about sentinels!
1279
Also heres the 90's Theme Song for good measure.
1280
I hope Beast is in it.
1281
He's my favourite by far.
1282
wolverine played a pretty big part in the comics, so if they preserve that, will they bring hugh jackman in to play my favorite mutant or will they recast?
1283
The perfect way to do this is to use the time travel element to make the 3rd movie negligible while keeping the first 2 intact.
1284
Then the normal X-Men movies can continue to be made and James Marsden can find a job again.
1285
Do we know the plot line?
1286
So this means we are going to see Bishop?
1287
Shard?
1288
Nimrod?
1289
Doesn't that mean that Sentinels are going to have to be glossed over pretty damn quick in the movie to for non comic readers to understand what they are?
1290
X-Men First Class was something of a missed opportunity.
1291
The most interesting part of the movie was with Magneto hunting down Nazis while learning his skills.
1292
But it wasn't explored any where near completely enough.
1293
After that it got pretty formulaic, and the ending was far too rushed - seemingly just to get Xavier in a wheelchair and Magneto in a helmet.
1294
I personally would love to see a movie adaptation of House of M
1295
I really doubt they will use the original comic storyline.
1296
It is too awesome for that and will probably be seen as too dark.
1297
Why else do you think most comic-based movies suck?
1298
Instantly got a boner when I read the title to this.
1299
It HAS to have Sentinels.
1300
.and
1301
this cast list better get additions.
1302
Though I've heard there's no one NEW going to be added.
1303
Maybe one new character, but not many.
1304
Is this the arc with Apocalypse?
1305
Who would play him?
1306
Most badass villain in x men comics.
1307
cant wait to see how much they fuck this one up!
1308
story line wise at least. the movies are good but it drives me mad when i see what they do with the story/characters.
1309
Yeah.hopefully it capitalizes on what made the first one so good.
1310
I'd rather see an Xtinction Agenda trilogy.
1311
I love every X-Men movie.
1312
So glad to see this group at the helm of that story.
1313
It's always been my favorite narrative of the comic, and can't wait to see the casting for Colossus and Kitty.
1314
Like the Moody Blues album?
1315
Is this gonna tell me why is mystique becomes evil?
1316
In the 'first class' she was nice for a rising villan
1317
I am excited to see it, but i am somewhat worried about it.
1318
I have read some things saying that they will try to use the time travel aspects of the story to remedy some of the really obvious and ridiculous continuity errors that have developed between First class, the and X-1 through 3. I am not to worried about the Origins Wolverine problems because it seems they are willing to pretty much pretend that entire movie never happened, so the whole emma frost as a kid in it, but an adult in first class is not an issue.
1319
My hope is they jump ahead a number of years, allowing them to recast most of the secondary heroes or completely write them out.
1320
First Class had an Amazing A-team, and a terrible B-team in their cast.
1321
Every time Xavier, Magneto, Mystique were on screen it was riveting.
1322
Every time Banshee, Beast, Angel (stupid not Warren Angel, harumph) or Havoc were on screen it felt like they were only there to make you all the more excited to see Xavier and Magneto chat it out again later.
1323
This move has the opportunity to clear a lot of continuity problems up, as well as ditch the lame secondary people and pick up far stronger actors or just better characters altogether.
1324
Until more casting details start appearing and i get an idea of how they are going to proceed i will set my anticipation level at eager but reserved.
1325
best case scenario is (im not too familiar with these comic story line but) you have the cast from first class AND the cast of the original trilogy.
1326
that be dope
1327
Jeez, knowing nothing about the comics, this plot sounds like fucking chaos lol
1328
Just be ready for something completely different than what you remember from the comics.
1329
The comics have been going on for 50 years across multiple titles, so each year could probably make a movie.
1330
They have already strayed so far from the comics with these movies that I've decided to just pretend I don't care and take the movies on their own merit.
1331
Days of Future Past is probably just a working title anyway.
1332
Time travel doesn't really fit with what they've done so far in the X Men universe.
1333
I loved X-Men: First Class.
1334
Very excited as well!
1335
Coincidentally I could really see them pulling a Star Trek ('member X2?) and using this as a way to reset continuity in the series.
1336
That way they can bring in some A-List X-Men without conflicting with the original films.
1337
I, personally, can't wait for X-Men 17.I believe it's coming out in 2016.
1338
I am not looking forward to them screwing up this storyline.
1339
lol who came up with that title?
1340
Tetsuya Nomura?
1341
I can imagine whats next, X-Men: Dream Drop Distance
1342
I hope they don't fuck this one up too.
1343
X-men was my favorite as a kid, and they have ruined my childhood with those terrible movies.
1344
What a stupid title
1345
Super excited.
1346
I have high hopes for this movie.
1347
Fuck yes thank you please.
1348
Oh please please don't butcher the original story line.
1349
:/
1350
does anyone know what the storyline is going to be?
1351
Bishop and Sentinels.
1352
This is what I've been waiting for, for so many years.
1353
Awesome. as long as Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Kelsey Grammar, Rebecca Romijn, and especially Ellen Page are involved as well.
1354
Just watched xmen: last stand last night again and when the fuck are they making a sequel to that!
1355
I remember this story line being in the cartoon, but imo first class was a horrible movie.
1356
It barely matched up with any of the other x men movies.
1357
For instance, okay professor xavier gets shot in the back in first class, in wolverine he shows up at the end of the movie walking, when he picks up the kids.
1358
Also James McAvoy did a horrible xavier.
1359
The whole "calm your mind" was hysterical when he said it.
1360
I hope this next movie is good, but I have a feeling it will be corny, and not have any continuity with of the other movies,
1361
oh god, not the wachowski's!
1362
i hate those pretentious jerks!
1363
how about a john carpenter marathon?
1364
big trouble in little china, escape from new york, and the thing?
1365
sounds great to me!
1366
brokeback mountain.
1367
If it's real sex in a film that's a MOVIE and not a porn, then they're not acting.
1368
I don't know if I like him or not.
1369
Sometimes actors talk about directors and I think that I'm listening to a cult follower tell me about their faithful leader.
1370
It's creepy.
1371
It reminds me of how people talked about Shortbus.
1372
ugh.
1373
I'e said this before, but i really like Daredevil.
1374
Ye he was more tragic, but i think the Daredevil has always worked as a slightly more damaged character.
1375
He didn't have the Aunt May and Uncle Ben or the Ma and Pa Kent that a lot of other characters had to raise them up.
1376
And his powers come with a serious trade off, he is blind.
1377
Most other heroes don't really have a negative to their power.
1378
So that lets him be a bit darker.
1379
The part that won me over in the Daredevil movie was the scene when Matt Murdock heard someone cry out for help, but he did no go.
1380
He instead stayed with Elektra.
1381
Thats a far cry from most of the other superheros we have seen who when they hear a cry for help or the siren, they jump into action and leave behind the ever suffering girlfriend on the rooftop.
1382
Daredevil didn't, he chose her.
1383
The directors cut of Daredevil should have been the version that was released in theatres as well, it was a far better movie in my opinion.
1384
It contained many elements that the theatrical release should have kept.
1385
Any time someone needs to swim through a long underwater labyrinth, and somehow everyone seems to be able to hold their breath for super long periods of time, and they also seem able to swim long distances fully clothed or sometimes even burdened down by gear.
1386
Often something will jump out at them underwater, and you'll see them exhale in surprise much of their oxygen, but yet they can keep going.
1387
Every tried swimming fully clothed?
1388
Its frickin' exhausting.
1389
Day-after-Edit: I done wronged some words.
1390
ugh if only chris nolan would do this.
1391
o well
1392
reading this convo makes me realize how much i love LOTR
1393
Salvation was so much better than T3 imo.
1394
Bale did a great job I thought.
1395
Crazy Stupid Love.
1396
Tried Love Actually?One of the best British romantic comedies.
1397
While You Were Sleeping is my all time favorite
1398
Here are some great, classic rom coms, everyone should watch all of these: Notting Hill, Sleepless in Seattle, You've got mail, Kate and Leopold, 10 Things I hate about you, Pretty Women, Four Weddings and a Funeral, She's All That, While You Were Sleeping.
1399
Shaun of the Dead - Zom Rom Com
1400
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is pretty good!
1401
Amelie
1402
Person meets person.
1403
Person deceives other person because of an ulterior motive for forging a relationship or out of their own insecurity & fear of rejection.
1404
The couple fall in love.
1405
Deceitful person's ruse is either foiled or they admit the deceit.
1406
The deceived person is disgusted & never wants to see the deceiver again.
1407
They are both heart broken.
1408
Then one of them or their friends attempt a reunion that results in an admission of love & a happily ever after.
1409
There, you never have to watch another rom com again.
1410
My gf made me watch 'The Proposal' with Ryan Reynolds and it actually wasn't bad.
1411
500 Days of Summer.
1412
That is if your friend likes her rom-coms to be a bit bittersweet and lovely!
1413
Groundhog Day
1414
Two of my personal favorites, while not possibly being terribly popular, are You've Got Mail and A Lot Like Love.
1415
I think the acting in both of them is fantastic and there's plenty of that cute, novel rom com dialogue.
1416
Annie Hall and When Harry Met Sally are two of my favorite rom coms ever and have pretty much the standard for rom coms.
1417
500 Days of Summer is a great one too.
1418
Just Friends.
1419
The Princess Bride.
1420
It's one of the greatest movies of all time and i am amazed no one else has brought it up yet.
1421
50 first dates
1422
"Definitely, Maybe", "He's just not that into you", "The 5 year engagement", "Bridget Jones Diary".
1423
Bridesmaids.
1424
One of my absolute favorites that my brother even likes is Americas Sweethearts and Serendipity is pretty good as well.
1425
I like rom coms a little less rom and more com though but these ones are sweet.
1426
Mumford.
1427
A very underrated movie.
1428
I quite like Fool's Gold.
1429
The atmosphere is nice, and it is pretty funny.
1430
Speaking of rom coms, you should totally visit /wingmom.
1431
We are making a push at reddit collaborating together to make a screenplay.
1432
Down With Love very funny and clever.
1433
plus, Ewan McGregor
1434
If she likes Meg Ryan, get a whole bunch of those.
1435
Meg pretty much play the same role in every rom com she's in.
1436
French Kiss, IQ, Sleepless in Seattle are a few of my favorites.
1437
I don't know if you can technically count Legally Blonde as a romcom, but it's my favorite chick flick, for sure.
1438
reddit!
1439
'No strings attached' is a great one!
1440
'The Last Song' 'The Notebook' 'The Ugly Truth' 'Made of Honour' Easy A' 'Friends With Benefits' 'The Vow' 'killers' 'letters to Juilet'
1441
I really liked Adventureland.
1442
If they direct it will be shit, they have 1 great movie to their credit the rest are shite.
1443
2013? That's a lot of re-releases!
1444
Don't think its been said yet but I recently watched 'Stuart: A Life Backwards for the first time; its pretty moving and sad, as well as being funny, and Tom Hardy's acting is amazing.
1445
Kill the Irishman.
1446
Never Let Me Go Million Dollar Baby The Bridge Marley & Me Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father
1447
Sunset Blvd.
1448
Link: /r/tipofmytongue.
1449
I highly doubt this will go anywhere, but humoring you for a moment, what would happen if you finished a script?
1450
Who would get credit?
1451
How would you sell it?
1452
Even if you got independent filmmakers to make the movie, you would need to have some kind of legal parameters laid out in case someone offered to distribute it.
1453
this sounds like a movie that should have been made in the 90's starring Freddie Prinze Jr. mathew Lillard and Melissa Joan hart.
1454
I'm going to use my opinions and knowledge of movies to tell you that constructing a film remotely by committee is an awful idea and any small chance it has in getting off the ground will be sabotaged reddit's lack of film literacy and basic competence.
1455
Escape while you can.
1456
Steal the idea for your own and shoot it with a DV camera.
1457
Slap "Mumblecore" on the label, and you'll be the scream of Sundance.
1458
During the shallow, awful parties, go on about how it's a film for the social media generation and you'll get a distribution deal in no time.
1459
Not only crediting the author of the content that you are using, but having consent to use his or her work with or without pay to be used in a film that intends to receive money in the form of a profit is something that needs to be specified in a contractual agreement, and signed by somebody who is either 18 years of age of a parent/guardian who is 18 years of age who can sign that kind of contract with their consent for them.
1460
Although in theory this sounds like a wonderful collaborative idea, there is a huge list of legal liabilities riding on the filmmaker's shoulders, that if not handled correctly and accordingly, will run the director, producers, and any studio involvement into massive debt and legal issues.
1461
This is why having the people who are working on the film, physically with you to sign those papers and work for you, is ideal in ensuring this is an issue that doesn't arise.
1462
Writing those contracts will require hiring a lawyer who specializes in these contractual agreements, who can also make multiple custom contracts to identify and individualize the agreements based upon the person's requests.
1463
This is all incredibly expensive, and doesn't even include the cost of the actual film itself.
1464
I don't mean to be a debbie downer, but you need to find a way to either gain the funding to pull such a task off (similar to how the YouTube collaborative "Life in a Day" film was pulled off), or disassociate it from reddit and its users.
1465
Venom is supposed to be invisible to Spidey-Sense, if I remember correctly.
1466
Doctor Doom was absolutely terrible in Fantastic Four.
1467
Probably the most disappointed I've been by an adapted character.
1468
Also, for not being a native speaker, you have a command of the language most native speakers lack.
1469
Spider sense is something that always seems to get messed up.
1470
Sometimes he has it sometimes he doesn't.
1471
He only ever uses it when its needed for the plot.
1472
In general Wolverine irritates me because whilst i do like hugh jackman as wolverine, he isn't wolverine.
1473
So many people always go "omg he IS wolverine nobody else could ever do it" If you ever saw wolverine in comics or cartoon he is nothing like that, He should be shorter, more built, waaay angrier and short tempered and much more violent.
1474
He has blades coming from his hands and nobody ever sheds a drop of blood.
1475
Nothing really.
1476
I just think of them as "elseworld" stories and enjoy the fuck out of them.
1477
I don't mind nitpicking, but I would much rather enjoy the movie as it is.
1478
Some jackass decided to pass creating this in cinema for a cloud of unimposing space dust.
1479
Batman doesn't quit
1480
I don't consider myself a comic book buff by any stretch of the imagination, but I get mildly irritated when comic book movies mess with defining characteristics of established characters.
1481
The X-Men film series was particularly bad about this.
1482
Why was Wolverine so likable?
1483
Why was Cyclops so spineless and irrelevant?
1484
Why were Cyclops and Professor X vaporized in the third film?
1485
Why did Deadpool gain Cyclops and John Wraith's powers, turn into Baraka from Mortal Kombat, and lose his ability to speak in Origins?
1486
Why was Emma Frost so young in Origins, but so old in First Class?
1487
Why was Havok so old in First Class?
1488
Why did Sebastian Shaw become a Nazi and kill Magneto's mother?
1489
Spider-Sense doesn't work on Venom
1490
In the Kick-Ass comic, Dave doesn't get the girl at all.
1491
It is in essence a story about how he gives up everything in his life to fight crime, as his only real triumphs are as Kick-Ass, not as Dave.
1492
If there is one thing that is clear in the books and not in the film, it is that Dave's life starts bad and is made continually worse by his moonlighting as a crimefighter.
1493
This is very effective because we see just how much he gives up for his ideals, and helps enforce the "real world" vibe.
1494
A minor detail for sure, but one that completely alters the tone of the film.
1495
deadpool.
1496
they totally fucked with deadpool in x-men origins and destroyed his opportunity for a movie
1497
Juggernaut is not a mutant, so Leach should not have been able to neutralize his powers in X-men 3.
1498
In Ghost Rider johnny blaze is supposed to sell his soul to save his girlfriend's life, in the movie he sells his soul to save his father.
1499
The former is a lot more poetic and justified then the latter.
1500
Also the entire tone of the ghost rider movies is completely different from the comics.
1501
The casting of eric forman for the role of Venom.
1502
Venom is supposed to be a physically imposing figure not some scrawny witty character.
1503
I don't like how Iron Man reveals his identity, I find this absolutely ridiculous.
1504
The total absence of Sentinels in the X-men movies.
1505
Changing Evey's character in V for Vendetta from a prostitute to a television employee.
1506
After seeing Avatar in 3d, I realized the format was not for me.
1507
I just see everything in 2d now regardless.
1508
Biodome.
1509
I just remembered that I kind of liked The Arrival, and am downloading it this moment.
1510
The interpretation I like is that the final vision is another dream.
1511
But because of the help he is getting those who are important to him (wife and daughter) join him to fight the storm rather than becoming evil and attacking.
1512
Your interpretation is cool, but I tend towards the above.
1513
I'm very much like your friend.
1514
Movies shot in 3D make use of the technology to immerse the viewer in the scene.
1515
Post-converted 3D movies use computer algorithms to create the illusion of 3D.
1516
These movies tend to be have no dynamism in the shots because even though the movie may have been "planned" to be post-converted everything falls flat.
1517
Movies shot in native 3D include Avatar, Transformers DOTM, Amazing Spider-man, Prometheus, ParaNorman just to name a few.
1518
If you've seen these film in 3D then you know how immersive the movie as a whole is.
1519
I'm one of the few who strongly dislikes 3D films, no matter what production techniques are used.
1520
Aside from the fact that it almost always gives me a stabbing headache, I am very irritated by the forced interocular and parallax.
1521
The eyes and brain create a stereo image by recognizing convergence and divergence.
1522
For me, it's like trying to read a book while having someone grab my finger, run it along beneath the text, and insist that I read with a cadence they dictate.
1523
Basically, it's really, really fucking annoying to me.
1524
While, yes, there are some spectacularly impressive visual results, I find that 3D detracts from my enjoyment of a film.
1525
Rather than adding a dimension to the storytelling process, I think that it simply adds bells and whistles that inhibit my ability to lose myself in a film.
1526
tl;dr-I fucking hate 3D in film, and I want it to die.
1527
(Until we invent the holodeck.)
1528
I tend to watch a movie for the story/action and if the colour aspect of it is well managed then it's a bonus.
1529
My friend however refuses to see a movie if it is shot in black and white and then colourized.
1530
He would rather just see the black and white version.
1531
Is he over analysing or am I not paying enough attention?
1532
When you shoot in 3D, you have two lenses, each basically representing an "eye".
1533
When processed (there are multiple ways) and played back on a 3D system, each eye basically sees what the related lens was seeing.
1534
When you turn 2D content into 3D content, there are a variety of ways, but they usually all revolve around making a "depth map" with which you "texture" the 2D content.
1535
A depth map is basically a black and white recreation of the scene's geometry, with pixels that represent "near" being whiter, and "far" pixels being darker (usually).
1536
Depending on how much time is spent on making a depth map for each individual "color 2D" frame that was shot, the results of conversion can vary widely.
1537
If a great deal of time is spent, decent results can certainly happen, and if the film leans very heavily towards CGI, then how much filming was done with "real 3D" becomes a bit less important.
1538
3D models can just be rendered from each eye's perspective, and turned into a 3D ready image fairly simply; this happens in films that use CGI and are turned into "3D" whether or not the filming of it was done in real 3D.
1539
Some auto 2D-;3D conversion relies on other visual tricks, one being "optical flow".
1540
In scenes where there's a decent amount of movement and/or camera panning, if you take an image from one frame, and the next, and compare the difference you get decent amount of detail that you can use to help in making a depth map more realistic.
1541
So, you might do the broad strokes by painting your depth map manually, and then composite some details gained from the optical flow analysis, probably manually tweaking.
1542
Where things can really go awry is when the depth maps are low detailed, simple geometry or optical flow type analysis is used without much care for depth.
1543
The former will make things like trees seem ridiculously simplified - I remember Alice In Wonderland having trees that looked like the depth map must have been a cylinder for the trunk with a sphere placed on top.
1544
Stuff that relies heavily on optical flow/frame difference may seem "kinda 3D" in tight closeup scenes, but really sucks if there's stationary stuff, and is generally hard on the eyes.
1545
I've vastly oversimplified some stuff here, but if you have any more questions feel free to ask.
1546
I think it was definitely JGL's best performance, by far.
1547
The kid did a damn good job also, and I hated Rainn Wilson's character but thought he was impressive.
1548
Natalie Portman was good, but paled compared to the rest.
1549
The motives behind Hesher honestly don't make much sense to me, but that is what drove the movie and kept in compelling.
1550
His monologues were fucking great, but I don't think they actually brought anything to the story or had any context.
1551
I was conflicted on it, because the acting was great but the story went nowhere and had no real resolution.
1552
I think youre stuck on the surface level of the character.
1553
He goes through life and makes it through his issues in very unconventional ways.
1554
The movie really isnt about him as a person at all, in my opinion.
1555
Its about his viewpoints and life lessons, and how "normal" people dealing with tragedy, need to just let it all go.
1556
He's kind of a manifestation of that.
1557
Personally, I would rather have a friend who is a prick and tells me things straight up, than someone who would either coddle me, or someone who would just leave me to deal with everything on my own.
1558
The fact that Hesher doesn't just leave, shows that there is more to him than what he portrays on the surface.
1559
Also, I think Natalie Portman is the only character that comes off as one dimensional.
1560
Not sure if that makes sense or not, but its just my opinion.
1561
In the commentary, JGL calls Hesher "a mystic fool."
1562
When I heard that, it helped the whole movie make more sense.
1563
He is a fool, but his foolishness serves the larger purpose of dragging the other characters out of their grief and self involvement.
1564
Friend of a friend was just like Hesher.
1565
All the way through the movie I was reminded of how the guy would start singing Gwar songs at inappropriate times.
1566
"Retarded children should be fucked and not heard!"
1567
While we were in a family restaurant.
1568
As a character study, it was mediocre at best.
1569
Sure there are people out there like him.
1570
The guy wasn't that much of a shakeup to their lives or a positive force.
1571
Each character would have been at least as good off with never meeting him.
1572
"I wanted to have sex with the Transformers too, but Michael Bay just didn't think it was right for the vibe of the film."
1573
I think it's because of the ending action and resolution feeling a little bit forced.
1574
I enjoyed it, but it would be hard for me to recommend it with no reservations.
1575
Snowtown was a bleak, unforgiving movie.
1576
It was really hard to watch, but completely worth it.
1577
The cinematography, the acting, the story behind it.
1578
and Daniel Henshall is fucking incredible.
1579
He goes from charming to sociopath in a second.
1580
He really captured the charisma of John Bunting.
1581
You could see how people would follow him into committing murders, and that makes it entirely more horrific.
1582
Honestly, I started watching this movie and I could not get past the first half hour or so.
1583
The sexual abuse scenes were too graphic and realistic for me and I had to turn it off.
1584
So, I actually just watched this last night.
1585
I was scrolling through Netflix and stumbled upon it.
1586
I read the quick description and decided to give it a go since I'm quite fascinated with true crime/serial killers.
1587
I live in the states and this was the first time hearing about the Snowtown murders.
1588
Starting off I could tell it was going to be the kind of movie that you just experience (like you stated).
1589
No extra bells and whistles, just the true grit and reality of the situation.
1590
I could tell my boyfriend wasn't so sure about it.
1591
He actually was done with it when the rape scene started.
1592
I can understand that but I see how it was important to the story line.
1593
A lot of things had to be going on in this kids life for HIM to go along with Hunting.
1594
I'm glad I watched it and I plan on watching the documentary about it now.
1595
I love getting into the minds of these people.
1596
I went to the premiere at last year's Toronto International Film Festival not knowing anything about the case, and it completely blew me away (I am a bit of a true crime buff).
1597
The bleak tone brought to mind Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.
1598
The performances were incredible, and I loved the score, too.
1599
It got me looking up more of Jed Kurzel's work, and I've become a big fan of The Mess Hall (many of their videos were directed by Justin Kurzel, too).
1600
Looking forward to seeing what the Kurzels do next.
1601
I live in the US and had no knowledge if thus case until watching the movie.
1602
Watching the movie it seemed to me that Bunting wasn't that bad of a guy as he was killing child molesters.
1603
I'm still confused about some of the characters, I would have liked to see more detail on the victims to feel some sorrow for them perhaps.
1604
I'm surprised this was the director's debut and I thought the guy playing Jamie was amazing!
1605
Can you please tell me more about the case?
1606
Wow.
1607
Just started watching this last night and have had to turn it off twice.
1608
We haven't even made it to the crimes yet.
1609
Just minutes in we noticed the constant smoke in every depressing scene, it made me feel hopeless and smothered.
1610
I love how the movie drug you in like a fly on the wall of their home.
1611
It was a bit heavy for bedtime viewing last night, finishing up today.
1612
Watched it yesterday as well.
1613
It is a very good film.
1614
Every scene is penetrated by this deep sense of foreboding and dread.
1615
The movie is quietly terrifying.
1616
They use this pulsing rhythm in the background during a lot of scenes, sometimes you'll notice it, other times you won't -- but it makes the film drive forward with ferocity despite it being so quiet and mysterious.
1617
And the performances were nothing short of marvelous.the
1618
guy playing John really should be nominated for an Oscar.
1619
It's highly unlikely since this is a small Australian flick but there is no reason he doesn't belong in that category.
1620
I think this is this director's debut and if so this guy is gonna be a huge talent to watch.
1621
I watched it last night (had no idea it was based on a true story) and this morning i couldn't help but feel that this story seems eerily familiar and then i realized it had a lot of similarities to a season of Dexter which really intrigued me and made me google snowtown murders to find out it was based on a true story and Dexter did use things from the murders and literally 2 hours after reading all this information on the events that took place i went back and watched it again and thought it was even better.
1622
I don't know if it makes me a bad person for enjoying this movie as much as i did but i really really enjoyed it.
1623
Watching it with my father was a mistake.
1624
The score was very good but
1625
The film is excellent, but I don't think it's healthy to watch it too many times.
1626
It punched me in directly in the soul.and
1627
hurt for days.
1628
There are worse people that could be at the helm.
1629
Depending on the story and direction they could easily make it work.
1630
Sad or cry your eyeballs out sad?
1631
It could be because i am a huge dog person but Old Yeller and Marley and Me made me curl up in on my bed and cry like a baby.
1632
Too many feels :(
1633
I love the movie but i am incredibly biased towards anything that Ben Foster is in.
1634
Seeing as it made a profit of over 170 million just in theaters alone i would say Salvation didn't nearly kill shit.
1635
Honestly i don't understand all the hatred for the film.
1636
Personally i thought it was 10000x better then that trash T3.
1637
When they are dead, we will see it anyways.
1638
There is always the internet.
1639
;)
1640
Mean Streets.
1641
Smoke.
1642
The Piano.
1643
Bad Lieutenant.
1644
The Duellists.
1645
All of these are worth watching.
1646
Bad Lieutenant has some scenes that are hard to sit through.
1647
Smoke shows Keitel in a lighter, even somewhat comedic role: it's great.
1648
The Piano is really Holly Hunter's movie, but Keitel is the male lead, does a great job, and it's an excellent movie as well.
1649
Mean Streets is well known as Scorsese's first classic: De Niro chews up the scenery, but Keitel's more subdued performance (I think he's basically playing the young Scorsese) carries the film.
1650
My favorite Keitel lead performance is in The Duellists, Ridley Scot's first film.
1651
Keitel plays a French Napoleonic era army officer who fights a series of duels with Keith Carradine's character.
1652
At first you find him merely annoying - a prick of a guy - but by the end of the movie you'll hate him: he's the biggest asshole in the history of film, and Keitel is suberb in the role.
1653
Highly recommended.
1654
Smoke http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114478/
1655
Bad Lieutenant http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103759/
1656
Reservoir Dogs and The Piano are always the first two that comes to mind.
1657
Bad Lieutenant is worth watching too.
1658
Mean Streets
1659
check out Holy Smoke
1660
Mean Streets with Robert DeNiro before he was huge
1661
City of Industry
1662
He's kind of the main character in From Dusk Til Dawn other than George Clooney
1663
i came here just to say Brick i am sure some one else has said it but i just watched Brick and loved it; so i am going to say it again for emphasis.
1664
Speed.
1665
I had to get up super early for my ACT the next day and I couldn't fall asleep so around 1 am I turned on the tv hoping to find something to fall asleep to (I like the white noise).
1666
I ended up staying up til past 3 and only got a couple hours of sleep and felt like dying that whole test.
1667
Totally worth it.
1668
forgetting sarah marshall also go to a subway and watch the trains,one goes other comes.!
1669
Swingers.
1670
That movie helped me through a couple of really bad breakups.
1671
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
1672
That and 500 days is what I would instantly recommend.
1673
Scarface
1674
500 days of summer
1675
Hesher
1676
Annie Hall
1677
Blue Valentine is if you want to knowingly hurt yourself.
1678
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a pretty good break-up movie.
1679
Meet Joe Black.
1680
Makes you look at the whole idea of love in a completely different way.
1681
I also agree with Swingers.
1682
Both movies helped me through a rough break-up.
1683
That site gave me cancer.
1684
Cabin Fever - I just wanted to watch people who deserved to die, die hilariously.
1685
This reminds me of a story.
1686
So when this girl and I broke up we knew that eventually we would be friends again but right then it was still raw and we were still angry and annoyed at each other for several legit reasons.
1687
We had an opportunity before us though.
1688
The Break-Up was coming to theaters that week.
1689
We knew that this was our chance.
1690
We, as a freshly broken up, not speaking couple, managed to agree to see the movie together.
1691
We did not speak to each other in person much before the movie and things were definitely awkward as we sat down.
1692
Things were infinitely more awkward as the movie unfolded.
1693
Say what you will about the movie's entertainment value, it really hit the nail on the head with how arguments explode in relationships.
1694
We had a great laugh about it a few months later when we no longer felt intense annoyance at one another (as much).
1695
But John Cussack gets back with her girl!
1696
This makes it more depressing for me.
1697
Maybe "Three Colors: White".
1698
I watched it after I broke up and it was a pleasant experience.
1699
For me it was: Antichrist, War of the Roses, Scenes from a Marriage, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Faces, and probably most importantly, Closer.
1700
Nothing like a healthy dose of unflinching reality about the convoluted and frequently deceptive nature of romantic relationships to help you realize there's more to life.
1701
Old School Adventureland Empire Records Beautiful Girls Vanilla Sky Before Sunrise/Sunset
1702
The breakup.
1703
That ending just hit anote with me when they walk away.
1704
Totally not the ending I thought but hit emotionally with me
1705
swingers, fight club, high fidelity, snatch + entire season of firefly.
1706
6 pack of henry weinhard root beer lots of roast beef sandwiches this is what i did after my last break up.
1707
Why the fuck is Die Hard not on this list?
1708
I've never watched it specifically for a break up, but any time I feel down Lars and The Real Girl restores my faith in humanity.
1709
The real secret to getting over a break up is to do as many drugs as possible for 1 to two weeks and fuck up everything else in your life.
1710
Then you will realize that you need to get your shit together and that girl/guy doesn't seem so important.
1711
Something that always helped me after heartbreak or devastating crap was actually little known tv show (it was cancelled after three seasons) called Arrested Development.
1712
You should check that out, just being able to laugh was really cathartic
1713
This list is bullshit.
1714
No Spongebob Squarepants Movie?
1715
AWWWWW SHIT DI S I A GOOOOD LIYUST
1716
Everytime I'm on Reddit I see an amazing fact about ants, and it scares the shit out of me.

Vertigo, by Hitchcock

1723
I agree that it wasn't totally solid, but I really enjoyed it.
1724
There was something for everyone.
1725
Also I agree that JGL and Shannon were great, though Shannon's performance was the definite stand out.
1726
It even reminded me a little of his performance in Take Shelter, but more pathetic and somehow more demented.
1727
I LOVE that movie.
1728
Seen.
1729
Much better than I thought it would be.
1730
"They made him (Daredevil) too tragic.
1731
That's not the way I wrote him."
1732
No shit.
1733
That's how Frank Miller wrote him.
1734
Weird.
1735
He wouldn't reveal his least favorite in that AMA.
1736
I need my black panther movie, and I need it now.
1737
I like how Stan's just pretending Origins didn't happen
1738
In my mind, this confirms that Benedict Cumberbatch was at Marvel to discuss a Dr. Strange movie.
1739
I uh.
1740
I liked Daredevil.
1741
Not one mention of "Howard the Duck" .
1742
strange.
1743
I guess wolverine origins he either forgot about or likedbut that tried to introduce deadpool (poorly) and the entire thing was just awful.
1744
Didn't he refuse to pick favorites or criticize in his AMA?
1745
I wonder what changed his mind.
1746
Confession time.
1747
I am a black movie/comic book nerd and It was always my dream to star in either a luke cage, black panther, or spawn movie.
1748
The sight of a black panther movie in the works gave a little twinge of sadness at what will never be.
1749
After reading the article I was floored that out of "Deadpool" and "Antman"."Antman
1750
is the closest to getting the green light"?
1751
WTF
1752
, and Fox is letting the rights revert back to Marvel.
1753
JESUS!
1754
Why don't you synergize all those characters too?
1755
It says Deadpool is in development Hell, but I thought it had a release date and test photos were recently released.
1756
Deadpool is such a popular character, I'd be surprised if he wasn't in his own movie in the near future, or introduced in another movie first.
1757
I like how he's just casually ignoring X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
1758
"Guess what.
1759
I'm Stan Lee.
1760
If I pretend it didn't happen, it didn't happen."
1761
Nothing was or will ever be as bad as Howard the Duck
1762
I want that Sapporo longboard.
1763
Will you get it for me?
1764
I've never read any Deadpool comics.
1765
It's been highly recommended by some people I know.
1766
Where should I start?
1767
at Fanexpo, he actually appologized for Daredevil
1768
Dr Strange Film?
1769
Hell yeah!
1770
I agree with Stan on Doctor Doom.He was so poorly handled in the FF movies.The movies were awful because of Julian McMahon's terrible performance,terrible writing and terrible directing.
1771
Dat Doom.
1772
He had just one Origin but nooooooooooooooooo!
1773
I loved the chemistry between everyone else in the FF movies.
1774
Perfect Surfer too.
1775
Pissed they have to reboot it.
1776
Totally unrelated, but that is some clever css
1777
I asked him this question during his AMA.
1778
It didn't get answered :(
1779
Fuck yeah, Deadpool.
1780
Fantastic Four was shit, didn't even check out the 2nd one
1781
I'd love to see a film starring both Daredevil and Elektra.
1782
Breaking news: Stan Lee says what everyone already knows.
1783
I'd actually want to hear what he thought of X-Men and the crappy Punisher movie.
1784
If Deadpool doesn't get a movie before I die then what was the point of living at all?
1785
SO BRAVE!
1786
The movie Thor was just shit.
1787
90% of Marvel movies are shit.
1788
Gary Oldman wouldn't approve
1789
"Kill Bill Volume 2" Wut
1790
Transformers There's such a rich and deep mythos associated with G1, and all they did was appropriate character and object names.
1791
Fuck Orci and Kurtzman.
1792
Bring on Bob Forward and Larry DiTillo for TF4, please.
1793
HI I'M HERE TO MAKE A SNAP DECISION ABOUT HOW AWFUL THIS FILM IS GOING TO BE BASED ON A LOOSELY FOUNDED RUMOR
1794
Between the mood of film you want and the types of films you've recently enjoyed, my suggestions are Drive, Children of Men, Collateral, and Snatch.
1795
(In that order of "closeness to what you'd be looking for.")
1796
Some wild cards that have nothing to do with one of your caveats- Heat, Hot Fuzz, Bad Boys II, Inglourious Basterds, and The Truman Show.
1797
Happy hangover!
1798
I'm glad to see the kid from Chronicle is actually having a career sprout out of that film's success.
1799
The last 10-12 years (since 2000) hasn't really brought us much in terms of film music Hold on a second here.
1800
Are we forgetting, just maybe, say.
1801
The Lord Of The Rings Inception The Dark Knight Trilogy Prometheus (Not a classic most likely, but still a great soundtrack) .
1802
Just to name a few, recent, high-profile films?
1803
The Fountain OST.
1804
So overlooked.
1805
Will I get in trouble if I mention Daft Punk's soundtrack for Tron?
1806
Star Trek (2009) - Enterprising Young Men Just glorious
1807
Michael Giacchino's scores on Up is among my favorites.
1808
Especially "Married Life".
1809
Here is a really cool fingerstyle guitar cover I found on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzhkxYX8GCw
1810
Other than Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean) who has already been mentioned here, I think Clint Mansell also gave us some great music.
1811
Lux Aeterna is one of the most famous songs to come from a movie, The Fountain had a really good soundtrack and I loved his take on Swan Lake's music for Black Swan.
1812
I also really enjoyed the soundtrack for Atonement and Blood Diamond, and Steve Jablonsky's My Name is Lincoln is a great piece of music
1813
Hanz zimmer - the dream is collapsing (inception OST) And the LOTR's OST
1814
I honestly thought Hedwig's Theme was terrible when I first heard it.
1815
Sounded like a reject from HOOK.
1816
It's grown on me through its association as the Harry Potter theme, but it's not as self-evidently awesome as, say, STAR WARS or INDIANA JONES.
1817
Are you asking about great scores, or enduring, identifiable motifs?
1818
We've had a number of the former, but very few of the latter.
1819
This title is a bit sensationalist.
1820
The actual quote is "I love that movie.
1821
Wish I could do Space Jam 2!" in response to the question "Do you love Space Jam?" I think it is safe to say that pretty much every NBA player wishes they could do Space Jam 2. If someone other than LeBron said that, no one would care.
1822
I don't get the hate, he answered the question about liking Space Jam and said: "Wish I could do Space Jam 2" he didn't say: "I want to make Space Jam 2, and if it is made I better be in it!"
1823
For Example: I wish I could get thousands of upvotes for every post I make to reddit.
1824
I would watch the fuck out of Space Jam 2, I don't give a damn.
1825
LeBron was answering fan questions and joking with fans at 5am on twitter and people are acting like he already signed up for the movie.
1826
What basketball player wouldn't want to do a Space Jam sequel.
1827
Don't You mean BasedJam?
1828
Am I. the only person here.
1829
Who's OK with this?
1830
The responses on r/nba compared to the ones here are polar opposites.
1831
At least he's a good sport about his hairline
1832
ITT people with rose-tinted, nostalgic opinions of Jordan who haven't followed the NBA since 1998 and don't realize MJ is a bigger dick and worse role model than LeBron in just about every fashion
1833
Get Ridley Scott on board and make it a gritty reboot.
1834
LeBron would sign with the Mon-Stars at halftime of the big game
1835
There is no need to be upset.
1836
Yes, more unwarranted hate for the guy.
1837
You guys are like those people that get texts from girls and read too much into it and take like 10 minutes to come up with a response.
1838
TIL Lebron James is a really nice guy.
1839
ITT: Everybody hatin on Lebron
1840
Despite all the people in this thread pointing out why they SHOULDN'T do this, the studios do continue to make movies about dance troupes and Eddie Murphy in fat suits.
1841
This is going to happen.
1842
Space Jam 2 with LeBron?
1843
No thank you.
1844
Jordan is irreplaceable as an icon for a generation, LeBron does not come anywhere near as close.
1845
Gotta love all the reddit hipsters ALREADY crying foul at the mere thought of space jam 2 with LeBron.
1846
Get over yourselves, the movie would be a blockbuster hit.
1847
I don't think it would turn out the same way.
1848
If that happens, I hope they don't update the Space Jam website as a result.
1849
It's a wonderful time capsule.
1850
He has the quote "what we do in life echoes in eternity" tattooed on his arm and it is also on the toes of his new shoes.
1851
Bill Fucking Murray should be in the sequel
1852
If LeBron doesn't do Space Jam 2, he will never be as good as Jordan.
1853
And his favourite basketballer is LeBron James.
1854
As a Clevelander, I feel obligated to hate him, but Space Jam 2 could be spectacular (but, on second thought, it could be terrible too).
1855
I just felt chills go down my spine at the very possibility of Space Jam 2. tingly
1856
Wasn't Looney Toons: Back in Action technically a sequel to Space Jam?
1857
already made
1858
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAbojIyN1zY&feature=youtubegdataplayer
1859
This video could not be more relevant.
1860
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71HTYEuos8
1861
I hope the site looks like this.
1862
ITT: Lebron haters because he didn't sign with your team.
1863
Get over yourselves, Lebron is a nice guy and isn't a dickhead like Jordan off the court.
1864
I'm sure if Jordan played in todays age of crazy extensive media coverage we would think differently of him.
1865
My friends hate on Lebron, but I think he's pretty charming.
1866
He's collected and well spoken off the court, and he seems to have a nice sense of humor.
1867
I don't want to try and compare him to Jordan, but I think he'd do a fine job in a movie like that.
1868
I don't care about what everyone is saying on this, I would watch the shit out of Space Jam 2. But only if they make a very current website for the sequel, and then never ever touch it again.
1869
fuck.
1870
skip.
1871
bayless.
1872
Lebron gets a vote up in my book, bc Gladiator is an awesome movie.
1873
You know, a few weeks ago, I actually said if someone wanted to make a Space Jam 2, they'd want Lebron.
1874
But they wouldn't be able to do it because he's too much of a douche.
1875
The problem is, Michael Jordan is a pretty big douche in real life as well.
1876
fuck that, you stay away from space jam lebron, dont you dare make a sequel
1877
Why doesn't he just participate in the dunk contest first?
1878
That's what we want to see
1879
I would watch the FUCK out of Space Jam 2
1880
I just watched Space Jam last night.
1881
What made that movie so great is that Michael Jordan was poking fun at himself and showed that he had a great sense of humor.
1882
I'm not sure LeBron could pull that off.
1883
He could be one of the Star Players that they steal the talent from.
1884
There's no denying he's one of the more talented players playing today.
1885
I fully support this.
1886
yeah and in lebron's space jam he'll switch teams at halftime because his team is so bad and win with the aliens.
1887
Its quite clear people here do not know a goddamn thing about basketball

1893
It would be hard to top the soundtrack to space jam.
1894
Brilliant!
1895
He would join the mon-stars at the end
1896
Lola was fucking hot.
1897
He named his son Maximus because he liked Gladiator so much.
1898
Why is this on the front page.
1899
Space Jam was awful.
1900
Nostalgia Critic put it best: BUNNY BOOBIES!
1901
Win 7 championships.
1902
That is, if you don't just simply metamorphosize into a Jordan clone by then.
1903
If he is looking for another reason for me to dislike him , he found it!
1904
NO!

Isn't Lebron just the worst?

1909
He's a vigilante.
1910
For fuck sakes.
1911
Wait, so no one's shopped "Are you not ENTERTAINED!"
1912
onto a photo of LeBron holding his hands up in the air yet?
1913
LeBron could not name a single member of the Beatles.
1914
In case anyone, anywhere EVER mentions Space Jam, I keep it in my computer at all times, so I can watch it instantly.
1915
So, now I'm going to watch Space Jam for the fifth time this week.
1916
Wow!
1917
You mean someone likes a children's movie made when he was a child centered around an activity that is his life!
1918
Let's speculate about it!
1919
If there is a second Space Jam starring LeBron James, I will kill myself.
1920
I think that could work.
1921
i say let him be in space jam, its been to long since the last bugs bunny movie came out
1922
space jam 2? it's about time :) lol
1923
FUCK LEBRON JAMES
1924
Fuck LeBron James and what he thinks.
1925
I've found the parent/child relationship to be the most moving, especially when the child is harmed or missing.
1926
There is just nothing so heartbreaking as the helpless, desperate love of a parent trying to find or protect their child.
1927
Way of the Gun takes a few diversions into the suburbs but for the most part it stays on the open road.
1928
Another that you might try is Powwow Highway, a little known gem about two Native Americans who take their 'war pony' to rescue an unjustly framed sister.
1929
Fandango might be one you would enjoy.
1930
College buddies pile in the car and head to Mexico to find their friend Dom.
1931
I know I am in the minority, but I put Jackie Brown as a close second or third only behind Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.
1932
I just love the feel of that movie.
1933
Great atmosphere, great soundtrack, and some amazing acting.
1934
Love it.
1935
The Matrix, because even though I still enjoy it every time I watch it, it doesn't have the "Holy shit!" impact that it had when I first saw it (as my first R-rated film).
1936
I think this list is partially full of shit, movies like: Kill Bill: Part 2, Eyes Wide Shut, Ghostbusters 2, Vanilla Sky; are all pretty good/great films, especially the former three.
1937
'Does Ron Paul partially endorse Mitt Romney for president?' TJ wrote, hoping no one else had already made such a lame and obvious joke.
1938
I don't understand this mentality.
1939
If you're going to speak, it has to be what we want you to say.
1940
Moreover, republicans are assholes and democrats have their heads in the clouds.
1941
Mathew Fox as Batman.
1942
Hear me out, the Speed Racer movie they made was actually really fun and his Racer X was all sorts of Batman '66.
1943
Stray Dog by Akira Kurosawa.
1944
One of Toshiro Mifune's earliest films, and I believe his first collaboration with Kurosawa.
1945
Still possibly my most favorite Kurosawa film.
1946
I'd also toss a vote for "A Woman, A Gun, And A Noodle Shop" which is a remake of the Coen Brothers's Blood Simple as a period piece set in pre-modern China.
1947
I honestly think this is a great fit
1948
I seriously doubt that most of the people who detest the Twilight films have sat through most of them.
1949
I say this as someone who hasn't seen any of the Twilight films, but finds the overreaction to them highly entertaining.
1950
Have you seen Agora with Rachel Weisz?
1951
I'll take Michael Shannon and Tilda Swinton.
1952
My favorite's Ali: Fear Eats the Soul.
1953
That and the BRD trilogy are probably his best known work.
1954
The Devil's Backbone.
1955
The boys' ghost story to Pan's Labyrinth's girls' fairy tale.
1956
What really seals it for me is the performance of Fernando Luppi as the doctor, and what happens to that character.
1957
I loved Pan's Labyrinth, but I didn't find it nearly as affecting as this one.
1958
Well, it might not be a detective movie, but Drive certainly has plenty of crime, action, and a significant amount of style to go around.
1959
I cried like a baby at the very end of AI: Artificial Intelligence.
1960
Even though the rest of the movie is just "meh," that reunion really hit me.
1961
Honestly, I don't want to hear a word about a JL movie, until Man of Steel is out & we can verify that the entire basis for DC's "cinematic universe" isn't a crock of shit.
1962
Then do a Wonder Woman movie.
1963
Only THEN are you allowed to try and sell me on Justice League.
1964
Leather on leather, with different colors of leather.
1965
At least it's not Michael Bay.
1966
I honestly don't know why they catch so much flak.
1967
I have found something fun in all of their films that I can recall.
1968
A Justice League movie without any prior films featuring superheroes solo is a horrible idea.
1969
Marvel did it right; their template clearly worked quite well.
1970
They saw The Avengers and its constituent franchises as one big investment.
1971
DC/Warner Brothers is going to have to look at the big picture and forgo the temptation of fast cash right now.
1972
I think this is good move.
1973
There are reasons to like and dislike that this could happen, but the Wachowskis are one of the best directors with an action pedigree.
1974
They also have experience with large scale pictures and sci-fi (which would have to be part of a JL film).
1975
Who else could bring all those elements together?
1976
If not the Wachowskis who could take on such a project?
1977
I honestly thought Ben Affleck was the perfect choice.
1978
His style is exactly what I'm hoping for for this kind of movie.
1979
Ahh brother and sister working together!
1980
When I read this headline I heard The sad Price Is Right tuba in my head.
1981
This just in: somebody may someday be the director of the justice league movie.
1982
Manhunter movie please.
1983
Until than, my life is not complete.
1984
As long as someone else writes it then it might work.
1985
So I take it that if they make this movie they're going to do what Marvel did and make movies about each of the individual heroes to establish back-story?
1986
Definitely feel like this isn't going to work.
1987
Most people will probably be seriously underwhelmed by whatever Batman movie they make (And it had best not be with Joseph Gordon Levitt, I don't want Nolan's universe corrupted by being linked to whatever shit movie they make about the Flash, Wonder Woman, etc.)
1988
But oh well, I guess we'll find out in a matter of years.
1989
Cannot wait for them to make a movie about Aquaman.
1990
Come on guys!
1991
We can use whales.
1992
WHALES!
1993
The movie should be made just because there are so many dedicated fans of JL but if it is made, they should re-cast Green Lantern.
1994
Been saying this seemingly forever: Idris Elba as the John Stewart incarnation of GL.
1995
Not prissy Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan.
1996
I think the Wachoski brothers did a fucking phenomenal job with Speed Racer.
1997
You could really tell they knew and cared about the source material, and wanted to bring it to life in the best way they knew how.
1998
With them behind the Justice League movie, I'm actually optimistic about how it would turn out.
1999
let the rumours be true
2000
Not a good idea.
2001
These two are the ideal examples of directors who got lucky one time in spite of themselves.
2002
Even the action sequences from the Matrix sequels were boring in their excess, and nothing needs to he said about their story telling inability.
2003
No serious adults enjoyed Speed Racer, so I can't possibly see anyone being happy with this.
2004
The Wachowskis are horrible.
2005
If they direct this movie, I will not pay to see it.
2006
They will promise us a DC analog to The Avengers.
2007
They will deliver a DC analog to Dragon Ball: Evolution.
2008
I. yeah.
2009
I don't know how I feel about this one.
2010
Never going to happen.
2011
Forget about it.
2012
Look "The Avengers" happened because nobody knows Marvel's characters.
2013
Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk -- they're all minor-league icons at best.
2014
If "Justice League" didn't include Superman and Batman, it would be pointless.
2015
But Big Blue and the Dark Knight are icons who sell too well by themselves to risk diluting the brand.
2016
Million Dollar Baby gets me every time.
2017
."tools of the trade".
2018
hmm I think that was a slight towards lebeouf.
2019
LA Confidential and The Third Man are good.
2020
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Devil in a Blue Dress, Winters Bone,The Usual Suspects, Blade Runner, The Name of the Rose, Mystic River, Seven, Ransom, Witness, Payback, The Drowning Pool, The Conversation, Fargo, Memento, Sea of Love, The Thomas Crown Affair
2021
Blue Velvet.
2022
The Man Who Wasn't There, though the main character is a barber (Billy Bob Thornton) the whole movie is done as a noir.
2023
Also, it's by the Coen brothers, so.
2024
High and Low.
2025
Angel Heart.
2026
(close enough)
2027
Memories of Murder.
2028
Winters Bone
2029
Double Indemnity.
2030
From a storytelling perspective, that movie was really ahead of its time.
2031
The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep with Bogart are classics of film noir.
2032
Forget it rajnshelat, its reddittown.
2033
Don't forget The Two Jakes (sequel to Chinatown) and I also suggest The Maltese Falcon.
2034
It's more of a martial arts movie, but you might like Bunraku.
2035
It's like Stan Lee directed Pulp Fiction.
2036
Blue Velvet and Brick come to mind.
2037
Inside Man
2038
The Long Good Friday
2039
Seriously?
2040
No one's mentioned Sin City?
2041
It's comic book noir but it's pretty much as noir as it gets.
2042
Brick
2043
The Naked City.
2044
I second LA Confidential.
2045
dragnet, don't hate its actually really good, and Dick tracey
2046
Man Who Wasn't There
2047
The Big Bang
2048
Se7en.
2049
Dick Tracy.
2050
le samurai if you haven't seen it I highly recommend this.
2051
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
2052
Brick by Rian Johnson
2053
Chaser
2054
It isn't really a detective film, but it is a film about a man stylishly trying to figure out why he was imprisoned.
2055
Oh come on reddit you know i had to plug Oldboy!.Blue Velvet, Primal Fear, Citizen X. I'll try and think of a few others and come back I'm blanking out.
2056
Memories of Murder
2057
since when is Chinatown artsy?
2058
I would suggest Bladerunner but I found it too overrated for my tastes
2059
Shame, Finding Neverland, Boy in the Striped Pajamas, Up, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.
2060
I have waited 20+ fucking years to see the final skynet Vs. human war.
2061
Just fucking give it to us already.
2062
21 Jump Street came out on DVD a few weeks ago, highly recommended.
2063
For more straight up action, you can never go wrong with Raider of the Lost Ark.
2064
For more suspense/mystery, do Inside Man.
2065
And if you've really got a lot of time to kill, strap in and watch Lawrence of Arabia or The Godfather; not action, but they're amazing, so yeah.
2066
I really did enjoy this movie, but I think it could have done a lot better if there wasn't so much of the mutated crew and more psychological horror.
2067
I loved Dennis Quaid in this film, and Ben Foster.
2068
He needs to be more famous, he stole the show in the remake of 3:10 to Yuma.
2069
This does not interest me in the slightest.
2070
I doubt I'll even see the trilogy when it's released in 3D.
2071
George Lucas pisses me the fuck off.
2072
I used one for two years exclusively and then finally gave up nicotene a year ago.
2073
Felt much better once I quit real cigarettes.
2074
Smoking is bad for you?
2075
No. Couldn't be.
2076
Not marijuana!
2077
That is really fantastic, anything that can be done to help epileptic people without harming them should be done.
2078
It's a great feeling when stuff like this happens!
2079
There's something very futuristic about it
2080
Why not just show them that one Pokemon episode.
2081
In all seriousness though its pretty amazing that we can even do this.
2082
JGL and Hathaway.
2083
The Raid: Redemption
2084
count of monte cristo.
2085
sooooo epic.
2086
the protagonist is just too manly and cool.
2087
Drive, IP Man, Chronicle.
2088
Kung Fu Hustle
2089
CRANK
2090
Old 80s action flicks are fun to watch while hungover on the couch.
2091
Stuff like Lethal Weapon, Big Trouble in Little China, Predator, etc. Drink beer while you're at it.
2092
Shaun of the Dead was actually made with the intentions of being a hangover movie.
2093
Just watching it, it has the entire feel of it.
2094
It is great to watch on a hangover Sunday
2095
Nekromantik 2
2096
Watch Hard Boiled, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Matrix, and Sin City.
2097
Ang Lee's The Ice Storm, if you haven't seen it, is the first movie that popped into my head.
2098
It's extremely well made, great cast and cinematography and everything.
2099
Black Dynamite.
2100
Kill List - thriller/horror movie with a crazy twist ending you won't guess http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1788391/
2101
Big Trouble in Little China.
2102
Jack Burton can cure any hangover.
2103
According to your movie selection, you would really enjoy Hunger.
2104
I'm not a fan of it, but maybe you'll like it.
2105
Edit: Take Shelter might also appeal to your tastes as well.
2106
It was much much better than Hunger, so give it a shot.
2107
Probably a bit late but Midnight Run is a classic
2108
what a coincidence.
2109
i'm sober, at work and also want to watch movies all day.
2110
The Proposition.
2111
An australian western.
2112
Guy Pearce is great in it
2113
Watch The Mist (2007).
2114
Clever low budget monster movie about a mist that eats people.
2115
The Hangover
2116
the most recent movies i've seen and really liked were martha macy may marlene, shame, submarine and jiro dreams of sushi.
2117
Those all look really good.
2118
So firstly, thanks.
2119
I could recommend some action movies, but as you have indie tastes, I don't think I could recommend anything that you haven't heard of/seen.
2120
Can you tell me a little more about your experience with action movies?
2121
You seem to watch a lot of new movies.
2122
Do you have any periods or genres that you know you're inexperienced in?
2123
Bernie.
2124
Jack Black inhabits that role.
2125
Badass
2126
Watch Requiem for a Dream while hung over, you won't regret it.
2127
Synecdoche, New York.
2128
Death is an odd thing.
2129
Breakfast of Champions, maybe?
2130
Most people compare it to the Vonnegut book and find it disappointing, but if you haven't read the book, you may enjoy the movie.
2131
You've probably seen Shakespeare in Love?
2132
The Neverending Story?
2133
Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang?
2134
Oh!
2135
You probably haven't seen Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead.
2136
Stoppard directed.
2137
Great acting.
2138
I'm sure you know the play?
2139
The interviewer comes off as an unprofessional prick.
2140
I think my least favorite and my most favorite part of the interview is when the guy asks Shia about a wingman.
2141
While Shia comes off as an asshole, I'd be pretty pissed off too if I was trying to talk serious about a project and the interviewer is all "hur hur I want sex too."
2142
Also, for some reason Shia reminds me a lot of Noah Wyle in this interview.
2143
He sounds super bro-ish when he talks, but I thought the Von Trier comment was pretty intelligent.
2144
What was Slater doing at the end there
2145
I can predict the end of the scene.
2146
Nawm sane?
2147
Shitty interviewer.
2148
Shia was remarkably (to me) well spoken.
2149
'The Beef' uses his meat
2150
When I first heard the news a while ago I interpreted the articles headline in my head as "Shia Lebouf Threatens to Have Real Sex in Lars VonTriers New Film."
2151
In not sure people understand how much money this guy has.
2152
Let's just say he has more than enough to last his lifetime as well as his children's, and he would never have to work again.
2153
At the point, wouldn't you only do what you wanted to do?
2154
I like Shia; I've liked him since Holes.
2155
I never necessarily viewed him as a "good" actor but I never really hated any of his performances.
2156
With that said, it's sort of hard for me to not look at him now as a snob with the way he has gone around talking about how he isn't going to do "mainstream" movies anymore.
2157
I understand his frustration with movies like Transformers, but at his age, is he really allowed the luxury of turning his nose up to the kind of movies that helped propel his career?
2158
If the concept of unsimulated sex in a film gets your bits quivering, you may want to check out the movie Shortbus.
2159
why would Lars von trier cast shia labeouf?
2160
Was he trying to challenge himself?
2161
He said,"Watch a pornography" I realize it is the same as porno, but I think its weird.
2162
I think Family Guy had the same remark
2163
holy beard
2164
Didn't know who Shia was.
2165
Clicked the link, thinking it was an actress talking about real sex in the film.
2166
Was disappointed to find out Shia is a dude.
2167
They both come off asshole-ish to me.
2168
The only reason there is hate for Shia is because all the circlejerk has basically pushed people to believe that.
2169
He is a very believable actor, in everything he does especially with CGI.
2170
He's 26 year old actor, trying to projecting himself as a 46 year old mature actor.
2171
Shia was going yesyesyesyes.
2172
The interviewer looks like Armie Hammer
2173
What a good interviewer.
2174
Because it's his choice, he can do whatever the fuck he likes.
2175
He doesn't owe you shit.
2176
Noooo, no no no no no no no nonononononono!'
2177
I just threw up on my pencil thin mustache.
2178
bleh
2179
Another interview with these guys about the movie.
2180
"I wanted to have sex with the Transformers too, but Michael Bay just didn't think it was right for the vibe of the film.".
2181
Shy-a?
2182
All along i thought it was She-a?
2183
He looks like he's preparing for a John Walker Lindh biopic.
2184
What would he be willing to do for that role?
2185
After watching this movie, I realized I needed a term for the regret you feel when suddenly learning that the movie you're watching has Dennis Quaid in it.
2186
Never really came up with one, because I'd rather not spend that much time thinking about the guy, but yeah.
2187
That's one reason this movie didn't become a hit.
2188
Fucking Dennis Quaid.
2189
As one of the few who actually liked POTC 2 & 3, I thought On Stranger Tides was a piece of utter dogshit.
2190
Maeby Funke
2191
Uhm I'm gonna go with the only producer that I can name off the top of my head, Scott Mosier
2192
Jerome Hellman and Robert Evans come to mind.
2193
How would you even know what part of the movie to attribute to them?
2194
I think I'm safe staying away from Twilight.
2195
I don't think I love or hate a movie based on opinion, but I've never seen Pulp Fiction, and based on all the rave reviews by my friends I'll probably like it.
2196
Oh, and counter to pop opinion, I was the only person I know to get bored by Avatar, it was pretty, but the story was incredibly overused and preachy.
2197
It's like his trying to piss us off.
2198
Wonder Boys is great.
2199
It's based on a novel about writing a novel.
2200
This makes much more sense than Ben Affleck, who I like but would've been out of his wheelhouse completely.
2201
I can't wait to give George Lucas money again =-)
2202
Zac Efron or Gabourey Sidibe.
2203
Both, really.
2204
I believe it's been discussed before among us mods, but I don't think anyone wants to go through the trouble to make one.
2205
Go for it if you want to make one.
2206
It's definitely not a bad idea.
2207
I know I'd join at least.
2208
I was in India for a week due to a flight complication back in 2001, and I managed to explore Mumbai for a while and actually visit a movie theater and watch a genuine Bollywood film.
2209
I can't for the life of me remember what it was, but the entire theater was trashed and very run down, although the seats were filled with people who were actively paying attention and enjoying the many musical scenes.
2210
The place was so smokey and dusty that you could see the light beam across the top of the theater from the projector to the screen.
2211
What the hell?
2212
Are there any neurologists here who can explain to me what the fuck is going on in OP's mind?
2213
A noun, as it was intended, although I can see the justification for it being an adjective.
2214
I think you should perceive it however you want to in the grand scheme of things.
2215
It's an alien (adj.)
2216
environment with aliens (n.) in it.
2217
I was going to say 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I'm sort of thinking of retracting that statement.
2218
Clark's novel was just so much more informative, but not so much so that it diminished the reader's interpretation of the events.
2219
I really like both, and I'm having a hard time deciding.
2220
I prefer the raw B-roll footage to the overly edited behind the scenes DVD specials.
2221
Just seeing the footage, the sets, the execution of shots and lighting is fantastic.
2222
Dear Zachery, Grave of the Fireflys, Brotherhood of War
2223
The Room.
2224
It's the ultimate tragedy.
2225
Everyone betrays Johnny.
2226
Just watch the first 20 minutes of "Up" and then turn it off when they're about to cart the old man off to hospice care.
2227
The Wrestler.

2235
That movie, boy, is some serious shit.
2236
Life is Beautiful.
2237
Lilja 4-ever
2238
Toy Story 3 And The Green Mile always get me.

Leaving las Vegas
2244
"Life as a House".
2245
I'm a dude, so I don't really cry at movies, but no matter how many times I watch that one, I always get choked up a bit.
2246
Green Mile was kinda tough for me too, but Life as a House was worse.
2247
Great movie though.
2248
Mary Steenburgen is a neighbor milf who starts fucking her daughters boyfriend.
2249
Really had nothing to do with the overall plot of the film, just a side story, but Mary Steenburgen made a good dirty old slut.
2250
the elephant man
2251
The Elephant Man.
2252
That movie destroys me.
2253
My Dog Skip.
2254
Seven Pounds, I will never watch it again.
2255
It was good but it was the saddest movie I have ever seen.
2256
"Wit," starring Emma Thompson, directed by Mike Nichols.
2257
The Wind that Shakes the Barley was heartbreaking.
2258
Le scaphandre et le papillon (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) - Based on a true story of Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby who suffers a stroke and has to live with an almost totally paralyzed body; only his left eye isn't paralyzed Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside) - The real-life story of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro, who fought a 30 year campaign in favor of euthanasia and his own right to die Awakenings - The victims of an encephalitis epidemic many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them.
2259
Big Fish - I don't know why, but the ending of this film absolutely got to me.
2260
Legends of the Fall, Lonesome Dove (mini-series)
2261
Im really going to have to go with Pans Labyrinth on this one.
2262
Just entirely dark and sad all the way through.
2263
Even the ending which is supposed to be "A Happy one" still has me pretty choked up
2264
The Truman Show.
2265
Think about it.
2266
The Rabbit-Proof Fence Its an Australian or British movie so a lot of people havent seen it, but I cried a little bit
2267

2270
Warrior Men In Black III
2271
Big Fish.
2272
No matter how many times I watch it the ending always gets me.
2273
Parts of the Royal Tenebaums mess with me pretty bad.
2274
Also, Children of Men.
2275
'Grave of the fireflies', 'the purple rose of cairo'
2276
'When the Wind Blows'
2277
Hachiko, a walk to remember, lost and delirious, the note book, my sisters keeper, and the woman in black.
2278
The woman in black has a sad ending.
2279
Buried - fairly gut-wrenching the whole way through.
2280
My Life is easily the saddest movie I've seen.
2281
Plague Dogs
2282
This.
2283
Saw it with 2 friends.
2284
We all cried like little babies, and I loved my dogs even more after watching that movie.
2285
Beautiful Boy
2286
rabbit hole?
2287
i didnt know anything about it before i saw it, and it was pretty depressing.
2288
I watched Mouchette and Sansho the Bailiff back to back once.
2289
Needless to say I was depressed for a week after that experience.
2290
Awakenings. "Learn from me! Learn from me!"

Excellent movie on netflix instant
2300
I get sad every time someone reminds me that Shyamalan made The Last Airbender
2301
Kill Bill
2302
It had me in tears by the end of it.
2303
It's a Japanese movie called (Daremo Shiranai) or 'Nobody Knows'.
2304
Just watch it, it's heart-breaking and a true story to boot.
2305
I get verklempt several times watching 'JFK'.
2306
'Deconstructing Harry' daydream banquet.
2307
Rudy.will always make a man cry.
2308
My girlfriend as witness to this.
2309
I can't think of any full-on SAD movies, but I was choked up and my eyes were starting to tear up at the end of "Taking Chance" with Kevin Bacon.
2310
The Fountain
2311
The English Patient
2312
Dad.
2313
I actually don't remember anything about the movie except crying through most of it.
2314
We Need to Talk About Kevin was just constant despair and sadness.
2315
I never want to see it again.
2316
It was good, but holy christ, if I'd had a gun nearby when I was watching it, I don't think I'd be here right now.
2317
The Wrestler
2318
Passion of the Christ - Specifically when Jesus falls down carrying the cross and his mother runs to him with flash backs of him falling down as a child.

God DAMN
2327
Paul Blart: Mall Cop.
2328
The first few minutes of UP.
2329
I can't help it.
2330
Why must it be so sad?
2331
Star Wars: phantom menace.
2332
Make me very sad for waiting all these years for such a disapointment.
2333
Transformers 3
2334
Green Mile, why has no one said this yet ?
2335
Jean de Florette, sad sad french movie, avec Gerard Depardieu, the legend himself
2336
Since you are in the decade check out "Friends of Eddie Coyle".
2337
If you haven't.
2338
It was the 70's and everyone was on some serious drugs, thats all you need to know!
2339
Unless you were watching the remake, then I feel so sorry for you!
2340
The Mummy Returns is great until the poor CGI with the Scorpion King at the end.
2341
I can't watch "The Blues Brothers" anymore, because this annoying kid I work with, who kisses the most ass I've ever seen a single person kiss has a "Blues Brothers" tribute band.
2342
So anything Blues Brothers makes me sick to my stomach now, because of that piece of shit.
2343
I like em all beside that one though.
2344
Brass Knuckles.
2345
Across the Universe
2346
Interstate 60 is along those lines, albeit a lighter/more fantastical take.
2347
I really like it.
2348
How much money the first film made.
2349
If you think back to it, did any of the elves survive after the battle?
2350
Not to my memory, how many men survived?
2351
a few men and all of the women and children.
2352
Ask me they should have left them to die, elves are the better race.
2353
Would have to say the relation between Jim Carry and Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
2354
Also, The Wrestler is a very powerful movie which deals with a father daughter relationship.
2355
Adaptation is a beast of a film.
2356
Check out Midnight in Paris, sounds right up your street.
2357
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Rain Man.
2358
Chinatown, a more interesting and complicated story in my opinion.
2359
I found it more fulfilling than The Godfather as well.
2360
OMG fook melies.
2361
team Lumiere brotehrs 4 lyfe!1
2362
False, Vertigo was.
2363
dude is terrifying.
2364
you can see joker flinch when he's talking to him.
2365
Hartman hands down.
2366
45 minutes of straight terror and laughter.
2367
No Saving Silverman?
2368
Travesty.
2369
This man was born to play J. Jonah Jameson.
2370
where the fuck is saving silverman?
2371
you mean he did something besides full metal jacket?
2372
First episode Game of Thrones.
2373
I like to think of Mini-series as super movies.
2374
Because you get a way more complex story while still getting big name actors and big budgets.
2375
I agree, I really liked Pandorum.
2376
The story was good and the acting was fine.
2377
The only thing I had against it was that some of it kinda devolved into a monster/action movie.
2378
Just running around and violence.
2379
Still very enjoyable.
2380
This is a great piece of science fiction hat actually progresses to an ending worthy of sitting through the entire film.
2381
Dennis Quaid is amazing in it!
2382
I loved this movie too, I love the setting and the idea of a haunted/crazed space mission.
2383
It reminded me of Event Horizon but with Ben Foster.
2384
And I love me some Ben Foster.
2385
Because it really isn't that good.
2386
The movie was at its strongest in the first 15 minutes where it actually had some good horror vibes going for it.
2387
It was legitimately creepy and frightening.
2388
But then we get a good luck at the monsters and it turns into a generic action movie.
2389
Shoot the monsters, run from the monsters, kill the monsters.
2390
It's been done before.
2391
If you want a good version of this movie, watch the Descent.
2392
This movie tries to be the Descent in Space, but it fails pretty bad.
2393
Also, the trailer was horribly misleading.
2394
I've yet to see Pandorum because of it's bad reviews, but I'm gonna now, you made it sound really good.
2395
I'll get back to you when I do.
2396
I watched it on Netflix, absolutely loved it.
2397
Very cool sci fi movie.
2398
While not the best, kept me interested the whole time.
2399
Because Event Horizon
2400
I loved this movie
2401
I loved it in the same way that I love The Mouth of Madness or The Faculty.
2402
They're well paced, decently acted, gory and extremely entertaining movies that I don't expect anybody else to like because for some reason movies like that are an acquired taste.
2403
I thought the movie was pretty damn solid.
2404
Super ninja women kicking ass all the time is dumb.
2405
It's the same reason Serenity makes me want to vomit.
2406
I liked it, it had some awesome sci-fi, time dilation points to it.
2407
The problem I think, is that it felt like severely different stories, the captain going crazy, and the dude travelling through the ship.
2408
It all comes together in the end, but you end up with multiple antagonists, multiple mysteries, multiple heroes.
2409
This is confusing to people, who for instance, like Tranformers.
2410
It really wasn't bad.
2411
Another one like that is called The Shrine.
2412
My girlfriend and I thought it would be a "B horror movie" and all through it, it gave that vibe.
2413
But the last 20-30 minutes this thing opened up to be a true horror movie and was very frightening and creepy.
2414
I can't even remember why I bailed on this movie 30 minutes in.
2415
I think Ben Foster is one of the most overlooked actors of his generation so I was excited to watch the flick but it just didn't grab me.
2416
That's the downside of endless video on demand for me.
2417
I bail on a LOT of movies.
2418
Back in ye oldern days when seeing a movie meant going to a theater (gasp!) or renting it or catching it on someone cable channel's schedule, I tended to watch almost every movie all the way through.
2419
If you enjoyed this movie, read the book "Hull Zero Three" by Greg Bear.http://www.amazon.com/Hull-Zero-Three-Greg-Bear/dp/0316072818
2420
Most people including myself found it to extremely generic.
2421
It felt like Resident Evil in space.The characters all felt very dull and two dimensional and after the first 20 minutes or so it just became another action movie.
2422
EDIT: My biggest problem though was that it did very little with its premise which was the Pandorum sickness.
2423
Had it left out the overused horror staple of zombie cannibals and focused on the mental aspect of going insane in space it would have been a much better movie.
2424
It was good, until all the parkour shit.
2425
5/10 movie for me, ok but not enough to recommend to friends or choose to watch again.
2426
It's hard to say, but I think it is definitely underrated, despite a few problems.
2427
I think it would have been better leaving the mutant human aspect out.
2428
It had only been 900 years (if I remember correctly) and not nearly enough time for humans to become mutated like that, even with radiation.
2429
I don't think that ruined the movie by any means.
2430
I think it would have served better to just keep to the aspect of the mentality of people in space, trapped in a ship, alien planet, etc.
2431
I really liked it!
2432
It was actually on earlier and I found myself watching a good portion of it even though I've seen it a bunch of times before.
2433
Sure it could have been better (most films could be), but that doesn't mean it was bad.
2434
Did anyone else think it was dead space the movie?
2435
The "monsters" in this movie were pathetic.
2436
I thought it wasnt bad, certainly more entertaining tham some other sci-fi flics of very recent times (that one must not mention lest one be downvoted into oblivion)It doesnt have massive plot holes like some recent sci-fi, and in general has a quite satisfying ending.
2437
It reminds me of old school sci-fi a lot, like phillip k dick or asimov, like an extended episode of the outer limits.
2438
Its far from perfect, but certainly does not deserve all the bad press!
2439
Probably give a solid 7/10!
2440
You wont feel like you just wasted an hour + half of your life as with other recent sci-fi, that one must not mention.
2441
I just found it quite dull, didn't really have any vested interest in the characters and the setting was just uninspired and unoriginal.
2442
Apart from the needle/eye scene it was pretty forgettable.
2443
So lemme get this straight.
2444

2446
The heart transplant scene KILLED it.
2447
"Spirits of dead Elves go to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.
2448
After a certain period of time and rest that serves as "cleansing", their spirits are clothed in bodies identical to their old ones.
2449
However, they almost never go back to Middle-earth and remain in Valinor instead."
2450
The elves didn't show up at all in the book.
2451
That change angered a lot of fans, actually - they thought that it ruined the theme of man finally being forced to stand alone and together against evil.
2452
The elves actually does not give up their life, only their life in middle earth.
2453
They go to the elven kingdom in the west when they die (across the sea).
2454
I guess it depends on how you view their immortality.
2455
Certainly, giving up the gift of eternal life is a monumental sacrifice, but the elves of LOTR are not invincible.
2456
They don't age like the other races but they can still be killed like any other mortal in Middle-Earth and as such, they're just as vulnerable to the death and destruction that Sauron would've inflicted on Middle-Earth had they not intervened.
2457
As such, I would imagine that while they view life and the act of living very differently then the other races (hard not to when you live hundreds upon hundreds of years), they still see death in the same way we all do: tragic, sometimes painful but sometimes necessary.
2458
So my ultimate guess would be that they don't view it as a loss of immortality, but a loss of life; which is tragic no matter the circumstances.
2459

Regardless of length, one has only one life to live.
2461
Yes. Yes it was.
2462
I think dying in a war is the same, regardless of race.
2463
Didnt happen in the book.
2464
The men had a choice: risk dying younger to protect their people, or potentially die later at the cost of their people.
2465
Either way, the men knew they would die eventually.
2466
The elves on the other hand had a much tougher choice to face: live for eternity in the undying lands, experiencing peace for all of time, or permanently die to protect a race that has mostly forgotten what it once was.
2467
Unlike men, the elves had an option that did not involve an inevitable death.
2468
They gave up guaranteed immortality and peace.
2469
They made the greatest possible sacrifice.
2470
Thats why this is one of my favourite scenes - it may not have been in the books, but the depth of their sacrifice gives the scene so much meaning.
2471
My guilty pleasure is Top Gun.

I was only 10 when my dad and I first watched it together so I didn't quite get everything that was happening but it's still one of those movies that I can watch anytime and be completely engrossed.
2521
Am I missing the joke?
2522
what is funny about that?
2523
Hahahahahahaha one of my favorite movies and I laughed very hardly.
2524
It was one of my favorite theater experiences.
2525
Intense, seductive, and incredible.
2526
What a ride.
2527
I think John Lasseter, who was the head of Pixar originally, being chief creative officer for all of Disney animation now everyone benefits.
2528
I think Pixar will bounce back, but joining Disney will be an adjustment period that they haven't gotten used to yet.
2529
I did a report on this for my acquisitions and mergers course, but the acquisition of Pixar by Disney is significantly hurting Pixar's films.
2530
Rather than seeking out new and original ideas, they are receiving more and more pressure from Disney to release sequels to their beloved films.
2531
Hence Incredibles 2, Cars 2, Monster University, and talks about a sequel to Finding Nemo.
2532
It's become too much about the money and less about the ideas.
2533
Ive always been a big Pixar fan but I sadly do see the quality of the films going down.
2534
Im hoping they may have just hit a rough patch and that Monsters University can pull them out of the slump they're in.
2535
I'm just going to say it, when the fuck are they going to do the sequel to Incredibles!
2536
Surely that warrants a sequel than that crap of Cars.
2537
Also Finding Nemo should never be a sequel, its a classic that stands as one movie
2538
I've said this before, but it's near impossible to gauge Pixar films in terms of quality.
2539
From Toy Story to Brave, I've heard strong arguments against each and every Pixar film saying why it's the worst one.
2540
In my opinion, Brave is not the worst Pixar film.
2541
I won't say what I believe is, because that's irrelevant.
2542
I think their work is still far beyond other animations in terms of quality, and I'm happy to see Disney giving them a run for their money because a little healthy competition might be good for them.
2543
The sequels are in all likelihood because of Disney wanting to squeeze money out Pixar's IPs, so I'd just assume ignore them as far as the quality of the studio itself goes.
2544
Still, they've done a very good job with sequels in general so far(besides Cars 2, which was just blatant merchandizing).
2545
Pixar has always made movies that explore worlds, from bugs to toys to robots in space, and the thing that might've made Brave feel like just another Dreamworks cartoon(imo) was that the setting wasn't really anything new; we've seen the silly scottish sterotypes in plenty of places before.
2546
With that said, the upcoming movies about dinosaurs and exploring the mind still have potential to be something special I think.
2547
I feel as if I should crash through a window, hanging from a rope, and scream DreamWorks at the top of my lungs.
2548
All of your arguments are based on the last year or two of films and then on assumptions of the qualities of films that haven't come out yet.
2549
You have no reason to think that Monster University will be any different than Toy Story 2 was.
2550
Also, Disney is Pixar.
2551
What about Dreamworks?
2552
They had the first two Shrek movies then hit it out of the park with How to Train Your Dragon.
2553
And with Rise of the Guardians coming out soon that's where I'm turning to see Best Animated features.

First he makes the prequels.

At which point I didn't think it could get any worse (Phantom Menace).
2580
Then he proves me wrong by making them into the crappy version of 3D.
2581
And even the good version of 3D is bad.
2582
Really wish they'd opt for an IMAX remastering, rather than this.
2583
3D is at its infancy still, there's lots more to improve.
2584
IMAX can't get much better than it already is.

As a format it's the most superior in clarity and detail.

Those were horrible movies.

I would really like to watch it for the "first" time again, so I can experience what older Star Wars fans had to go through.

2647
Basically, they were able to run (in few minutes) about 400 KM, in the desert, skipped the Suez Canal and didn't even get tired!
2648
The Hangover Part II: It seems that the kid (Teddy) didn't really care that he lost a finger and laughed it off.
2649
Also, his over-protective father took the finger loss of his pre-Med son very well too.

Every female lead in an action movie, does it all in heels.

Pretty much any time a human has to outrun a predatory animal.

We are not speedy creatures, man.
2653
Minus even more points if, along the way, the super-predator kills something else and then just leaves its perfectly edible corpse behind just to chase down said human.
2654
Off the top of my head King Kong was guilty of this with the t-rex chase scene, but it's definitely been done a lot.

2714
All the bad guys need to do is charge in at the SAME DAMN TIME and he's outta luck.
2715
But nope, let him beat up billy and then johnny its you're turn and then Julio is next.
2716
Its completely rubbish.
2717
The easiest one:The show "24" and how Jack is always "15 minutes away" from everything.
2718
DOES HE KNOW LOS ANGELES?
2719
It takes 40 minutes to drive 3 miles.
2720
Porn.
2721
No one remembers Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls?
2722
He survived a nuclear blast in a fucking refrigerator.
2723
star wars episode 3 (shit btw).
2724
"Come to the dark side!" "NO!
2725
I will never!"
2726
"You reaaaally should."
2727
"OK.
2728
Tell me how many kids I need to kill."
2729
How has nobody mentioned the "rope cure" from TDKR?
2730
anal sex in pornos
2731
Sex is such a beautiful fucking thing in movies.
2732
Everrrryone cums.
2733
The characters are always on the same "page" sexually.
2734
No awkwardness here!
2735
rambo, shooting two assault rifles, one on each hand and actually hitting all of his targets without aiming
2736
The one that always bothered me was Taken, I know Liam Neeson is an almighty badass, but jeeze he did take care of all those people relatively quickly.
2737
And dont get me wrong I still love the movie.
2738
Toys
2739
What gives you the impression it killed anything?
2740
It only came out 3 years ago, how often do you want terminator movies to come out?
2741
The gap between 3 and 4 was 6 years.
2742
The gap between 3 and 2 was 12 years.
2743
The gap between 2 and 1 was 7 years.
2744
Why would you expect another movie to be already coming out?
2745
Honestly?
2746
I'm still surprised #3 didn't.
2747
I really liked the theme of t4, do want moar.
2748
I hated the fact that in one scene an aircraft (I think it's a helicopter) lands on a Terminator, pinning it down.
2749
And then a guy stands over it as it looks up and BAM puts a bullet through its head, killing it instantly.
2750
I'm sorry, but did Skynet suddenly become funded by IKEA's Glass & China department?
2751
Because I am pretty sure that would have done absolutely nothing to any of the Terminators from the other movies.
2752
Because it wasn't Terminator.
2753
Despite the fact that the franchise is associated with a killer robot, the series is very much character-driven, and its about the value of humanity in the face of certain doom.
2754
Salvation was a big, loud, chaotic action movie; it sacrificed everything the earlier movies did right (even T3 largely succeeded in being a character-oriented story) in favor of imitating explosions and shit from Transformers.
2755
It didn't fit the feel of the franchise, and it alienated the fans.
2756
Poor writing, and a bad visualization of a Skynet production facility.
2757
Because the writers thought: Hmmm, machines need keyboards and monitors, how else would they interact with computers?
2758
Terminator ends with the knowledge that nothing has changed.
2759
Terminator 2 ends with the knowledge that things have maybe been prevented (you're pretty sure) and a robot has developed a small amount of humanity.
2760
Terminator 3 ends with the knowledge that nothing has changed.
2761
(Inevitability of the future) Terminator 4 ends with the knowledge that nothing happened in the movie.
2762
Everything's basically back to status quo by the end.
2763
There's no character development because we have so many characters in the movie.
2764
Term 1 has basically 3 characters: Reese, Conner, and the Terminator.
2765
Everyone else is a supporting character.
2766
Term 2 has 4 charactes: Both Conners, Arnold, and the T-1000.
2767
everyone one else, once again, is there for support.
2768
Term 3 has 4 characters: Connor, Claire Danes, Arnold, and the Lady Term.
2769
(everyone else is just fodder).
2770
Term 4 has Connor, Marcus, Lady Doctor, Reese, little kid, black rapper guy (Common?), and other lady who likes Marcus.
2771
Saw the movie once, can't be bothered to go to imdb and find out all their character names, because I didn't care about their characters.
2772
When they remake these, or add a new movie, they need to look back to #1 and see what made it worthwhile.
2773
Sidenote: Using franchises like this and Alien, IMO I think you can get a glimpse into what the "feel" of the decade the movie was made in.
2774
(80s, 90s, 00s, late 00s)
2775
People bitch about Salvation, but T3 is one of the worst films of all time.
2776
I may have been younger back when I saw it, but I actually liked the movie in an "entertaining-action flick" sort of way.
2777
I'm a huge fan of the franchise and I felt the Salvation was a great successor to a franchise that was just getting sillier as it went.
2778
I think what people are thinking is that it's the future, and that's it.
2779
It was actually 11 years before the terminator goes back to the past to kill Sarah Connor.
2780
It didn't.
2781
Aren't there plans for the next Terminator film?
2782
Supposedly being brought back to an R rating, if I remember correctly, I just don't know much details other than that.
2783
Because along with Avatar it helped launch Sam Worthington's career.
2784
Who knows what horrors a fifth installment might unleash?
2785
I'm going to just put it out there, I loved every single one.
2786
Sure some are better than others, some have characters we could care less about, and some strayed from our expectations.
2787
For me, each movie made its contribution and I enjoyed every damn second of it.
2788
Kyle getting a second chance to see the world before the war, sarah bonding with her son and driving train to stop skynet, john understanding his importance in the future, and the last movie is really what we all wanted from the beginning; screen time to see how humans are doing in the future and if they really stand a chance.
2789
No true terminator fan would of guessed that we had A-10 thunderbolts in the beginning of the war, and that they got into dogfights with prototype HK's.
2790
Its the little things that make terminator fans happy considering the time spans between the movies.
2791
I will even go a step ahead and say I kind of liked the Sarah Conner Chronicles.
2792
Did it make any sense?
2793
Absolutely not.
2794
Is Summer Glau hot? Absolutely.
2795
Was it nice to have something terminator to watch to pass the time?
2796
Of course.
2797
My main gripe with Salvation was how the atmosphere was nowhere near as dark and desperate as the future depicted in the previous movies (even 3).
2798
Also, CGI Arnie was unnecessary.
2799
I thought the over premise of it was fantastic!
2800
the plot of this series absolutely needs to be set in the future from here on out.I just think the overall execution was a bit lacking.
2801
The future in the old movies were depicted as dark and desperate, it felt like at any time under every other fucking rock would be a killer robot that pops out and murder fucks you whilst in salvation everybody just kind of walks around all nonchalant and safe.I think that was my biggest issue.
2802
Also the previews made it look like it was going to be dark and gritty like the "future" of the old movies but as I said the movie itself was not.
2803
I remember reading that Christian Bale came in and fucked everything up because in the original script his character didn't get enough screen time.
2804
He went through the script and changed the whole movie around or something.
2805
I am too lazy to find the article, but I am sure a google will turn up something
2806
Arnold Schwarzenegger is out of the governor's office now, give him a year or two.
2807
I just re-watched Terminator Salvation the other day.
2808
To be honest it's probably my favorite Terminator.
2809
I really liked 1&2 though.
2810
I don't want to be one of those "Stop liking what I don't like!" people and I accept that my movie tastes are suspect (I hated TDKR) but yeah, I thought Terminator Salvation was terrible.
2811
I also thought T3 was terrible, but there was never a moment where I didn't expect it to be.
2812
As soon as you saw the trailer you knew.
2813
But with T4, I honestly believed that this was it.
2814
That this was going to be amazing.
2815
This could be one of those "I saw it in the theater" movies.
2816
I'm 29, I feel like our generation doesn't have a lot of them.
2817
In the T4 trailer, it seemed so dark, and intense, and plot driven.
2818
the scene where Spoiler was chills inducing in the trailer.
2819
But by the time they got to it in the actual movie, it seemed almost comical.
2820
Like a cheap action movie that briefly thought about having depth, but the producers decided not to.
2821
I dunno, I'd love to see some more out of the franchise, but really, I think I wouldn't mind there just being a new, really good future war robot monster apocalypse movie series.
2822
Because it was DUMB.
2823
I imagine it was meant to gave a twist, but it was spoiled by the trailers and telegraphed by mile.Plus it actually did end the franchise.
2824
If not for the awful voice over, Skynet would be dead.
2825
4 was okay, but 3 was the worst of them all
2826
In other news, VanePales has poor taste in movies.
2827
Seriously, though, I checked some of his other lists and he has Roger Ebert and Terry Gilliam on his list of "WORTHLESS and ANNOYING TROLLS IN REAL LIFE", had Inception as his #3 worst movie of all time, seems to hate anyone that could be considered "nerdy", criticizes Inception for being unoriginal while calling The Ring the 8th best movie of all time (it is a REMAKE of a Japanese movie of the same name), called the 2005 War of the Worlds remake #14, Hannibal (sequel to Silence of the Lambs) at #17 (and Silence isn't even on the list), Chronicle's his #11 worst of 2012, Avengers is his #2, Dark Knight Rises is #1, he has two movies that haven't even been released yet on his worst of 2012 list, he put The Raven on his best of 2012 list, god, he's like The Cinema Snob without the parody part.
2828
And that worst directors list?
2829
Here's some other entries: JJ Abrams (#2), Joss Whedon (4), Terry Gilliam (6), Kevin Smith (31), Edgar Wright (38), Brad Bird (44), Andrew Stanton (45) and David Yates (47).
2830
Christopher Walken's response.
2831
Daniel Craig and Rachel McAdams Fassbender and Portman is a great choice, though; DiCaprio and Cotillard is also hard to pass up.
2832
The Boondock Saints.
2833
Hugh Jackman has had to deal with Butter before
2834
I actually got a chance to see this movie at a film festival in Napa.
2835
Pretty hilarious.
2836
Large famous cast doesn't impede the story really, which is nice.
2837
oh dear lord Oliva Wilde is smokin.
2838
How the hell is Paula Deen not the main character?
2839
The Last Airbender
2840
The most recent one I can think of was Cowboys and Aliens.
2841
I was thinking episode 2. I could hardly watch it.
2842
Also, every Final Destination after the 1st one was disappoint.
2843
Dragonball Evolution: Nothing more needs to be said about this atrocious piece of shit.
2844
2 Fast 2 Furious.It needed more Ja Rule
2845
Prometheus: Now i know that its been getting savaged since release and there is somewhat of a backlash of people trying to explain why its atually a good film, Without going on another rant about the problems it has.
2846
I expected something more than a slasher film in space, especially considering it was from the man who created the original in the series and proved that Science Fiction and horror can be taken seriously and done to a very high standard.
2847
There are simply too many instances of characters becoming idiotic in Prometheus just so that they could be killed off, while in Alien and Aliens the characters who died did so as a result of all round terrible luck rather than the script having them randomly contract a case of mental retardation just so we can off them 2 minutes later.
2848
Eragon, I loved the books at the time, and I was really looking forward to the movie.
2849
Disappointed doesn't begin to describe how I felt.
2850
Sex and the City 2 wut, people expected this to be good?
2851
Not out yet but Jack Reacher will be
2852
Overall it wasn't bad, and it stood out by itself, but as a big fan of the graphic novels, the second half of Scott Pilgrim vs.
2853
The World left much to be desired.
2854
Also, Ramona wasn't "cool girl" enough, and Scott wasn't his "awesomely childish" self.
2855
Nevertheless, it's in my top 10 movies.
2856
This list seems to have too many recent movies.
2857
They should have made it ".of the last 10 years" or something.
2858
The people writing it are probably too young to know what was genuinely disappointing before the 90's.
2859
I think the list kinda loses some of its impact, since 90% of the movies are 10 years old or less.
2860
Were there no massively disappointing movies pre-1989?
2861
The Bourne Legacy wasn't nearly as good as the Matt Damon films.
2862
Not my most disappointing film but I was so psyched for Prometheus and for half the film I was quite pleased.
2863
then.I just.I don't know what happened.
2864
Alien 3. I'm a major Fincher fan, but that movie is just bad.
2865
Miami Vice.
2866
I guess my expectations were higher because of Collateral.
2867
Is Prometheus really bad?
2868
They think it is.
2869
Transmorphers.
2870
It was very bad with.
2871
well everything.
2872
I couldn't finish the movie because halfway through, the audio was out of sync on a DVD copy, i'm not talking 1 or 2 frames, i'm talking a full 2-3 seconds out of sync.
2873
I also rented the movie from Blockbuster.
2874
I was not a clever movie watcher.
2875
OP please amend your post to say "excluding the prequels".
2876
We know otherwise this thread will deteriorate into a circlejerk
2877
I think it's hilarious how many super hero movies are on this list.
2878
1 step closer to a totalitarian government.
2879
Cute, but anyone who has read the novel will know why this explanation fails.
2880
(Hint: the monolith is not merely a 3-dimensional object.)
2881
I took it as a double meaning.
2882
Face value is the knuckles but underneath was the Indy nod.
2883
He was talking about the brass knuckles, he said something about them being a classic when they used them to beat up the guy in the bar.
2884
you are probably right on both accounts, this movie includes tons of references, do you remember when Van Damme goes if 6 oz can change the world imagine the amount this will have, which is a reference to the world is not enough.
2885
THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND! (-- The Internet's opinion on everything)
2886
I think Basterds is right up there with Pulp Fiction.
2887
It was such a development of the Tarantino style, which I had become pretty tired of after Kill Bill.
2888
Not that anything in Kill Bill wasn't AWESOME, but that was the problem.
2889
It was just one AWESOME thing after another.
2890
It's like using cheat codes in D00M to get all the weapons and God Mode.
2891
You're running around like a badass exploding guys left and right and it's mayhem and everything you love about D00M, but before you know it.
2892
It's boring.
2893
It's just too much AWESOME.
2894
Inglourious Basterds was patient and skillful.
2895
A real surprise, and I love it for that.
2896
My opinion, in order: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Basterds, Jackie Brown, Four Rooms: "The Man From Hollywood", Kill Bill, Death Proof
2897
Reservoir Dogs will always be my favourite Tarantino Film.
2898
Love the cast, love its simplicity, love the story.
2899
Just a bunch of dudes dealing with the aftermath of a robbery.
2900
It's the type of film I can (hopefully) see myself writing one day.
2901
It gives me HOPE.
2902
Reservoir Dogs may not be a close second, but it's definitely better than Inglorious Basterds
2903
Reservoir Dogs is the best movie ever made, so I don't know what you're friends are on.
2904
When I first saw Basterds I hated it.
2905
But I've re-watched it one or two times since and it's grown on me to a point that I think it may even be (dare I say it) better than Pulp Fiction.
2906
But I'm still not certain on that.
2907
Regardless, I think you cannot go wrong in your debate.
2908
Reservoir Dogs is clearly a very good movie.
2909
Why not a tie?
2910
Kill Bill as a whole would be my 2nd.
2911
No question.
2912
I see your Marion Cotillard and counter with Audrey Tautou.
2913
Epitome of French adorable.
2914
For a male actor I would go with either DiCaprio or Clooney.
2915
Michael C Hall & Emma Watson.
2916
Aaron Paul and Anne Hathaway.
2917
Aw man that's tough.
2918
I think I'd pick Michael Caine for the actor and Bryce Dallas Howard for the actress.
2919
I don't know if they would fit well together, but oh well.
2920
I also think Marion Cotillard is the shizzle.
2921
Personally I'd love to work with Kevin Spacey.
2922
Viggo Mortensen and Jessica Chastain.
2923
Shatner and.Shatner in drag
2924
Fassbender and Portman
2925
Christian Bale.
2926
Dicaprio and Kristen bell.
2927
I'll never be able to stop looking at my one man crush.
2928
O and bell is nice
2929
Brad Pitt and Natalie Portman
2930
Toni Collette.
2931
I know I would make romantic comedies, so I choose Emma Stone and Chris Pine.
2932
1)Michael Fassbender and Michelle Williams2)Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan
2933
Orlando Bloom and Scarlett Johansson.
2934
They've both proven themselves to be great in both dialogue/character, and action scenes.
2935
And they're both way hot (saying this as a straight guy).
2936
Hellboy II.
2937
The Hellboy/Mignolaverse comics is basically my favourite thing ever, and the movies, while not very faithful, I absolutely loved Del Toro's take on them.
2938
I'll be the one to say The Usual Suspects.
2939
The ending was spoiled for me so I didn't get to truly enjoy the first time around.
2940
No one mentioned this, but how about a brick and mortar library?
2941
I'm spoiled where I live because our library system is awesome - you can search the entire database and get movies shipped for free from libraries all over the county to your local one for free (and usually in 1-2 days).
2942
The DVD selection at local library alone is great, and there's always something I haven't seen that I want to.
2943
Noun.
2944
It's an Alien.
2945
Nice.
2946
I have a good amount of those, but they are an odd size and I cant find frames for them.
2947
I'm big into horror films.
2948
That's awesome.
2949
Really like the re-animator one.
2950
SPOILER ALERTS: As a fan of horror films, that movie was not horror.
2951
it was disgusting and this is coming from someone who has seen their fair share of gore.
2952
There is fucking baby rape, necrophilia, pedophilia, rape.
2953
It wasn't scary or disturbing to me but like I said disgusting and also sad that someone thought it was a good idea.
2954
Very well done, I have watched it several times and the shock value remains in tact.
2955
I was surprised to have had to dig it out of a gore forum, I had never even heard of it through open sources.
2956
The ending just makes it.
2957
The line that sticks out the most to me, and is what I use when trying to explain the audacity of the film is 'Newborn Porn' &#3232;&#3232;
2958
I believe it's the hype from everyone around them saying Rocky could / should have won.
2959
Ego wins all.
2960
My speculations are ego, money, or brain hemorrhaging.
2961
The Prestige.I remember hitting the exit door and there was suddenly this glorious moment of clarity where the movie went from "what did I just watch that was weird" to "nOMGGGGG"
2962
Alien.
2963
No Country for Old Men absolutely fucking floored me.
2964
My wife had to drive us home.
2965
InceptionThere was absolute dead silence in the last seconds and I could almost feel everyone get off their seats waiting for the totem.Then the movie title came out and there were 2 seconds of a collective WTF by everyone
2966
The first scene of Children of Men.
2967
Actually all of Children of Men, but specifically that first scene.
2968
The image of that woman walking out of the cafe still sticks with me.
2969
The Thing.
2970
Spoiler but sadly most of the magic has been lost.
2971
I remember a guy once telling me when his grandmother was really young, she saw "The Wizard of Oz" not even knowing that color film existed before Dorothy opens the door into Oz.
2972
That would be a mind blowing first experience.
2973
Eternal Sunshine.
2974
The first time wasn't the best though, it's the next couple when you totally understand exactly what is happening and realise how smart the whole movie is from the basic premise upwards.
2975
Kung Pow: Enter the Fist.
2976
Spirited Away.
2977
I saw it for the first time on HBO right after it won its Academy Award and was absolutely mesmerized by it.
2978
But ever since then I've always regretted not seeing it on the big screen.
2979
Trainspotting, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Memento, Donnie Darko, Primer.
2980
All of those just blew me away the first time.
2981
'The Godfather'.
2982
I took it out reluctantly from the local video store when I was thirteen because 'everyone said I needed to watch it'--my parents reacted with utter joy, made sure I watched it with them immediately after dinner, and I was just blown away--my heart was in my throat the whole time.
2983
One of my favourite cinematic memories ever.
2984
Fellowship of the Ring.
2985
I had never read Lord of the Rings but my dad was a huge fan so he was obviously freaking out but I was just appalled with the massive, expansive world that had been created.
2986
That film was excellent in so many ways.
2987
To watch it over again would be absolutely amazing one because I loved it and two because it's one of the best memories I have of my dad.
2988
Star Wars: The Original Trilogy
2989
It's between The Exorcist and 28 Days Later.
2990
Just as FunPatrol mentioned with The Thing, that magic you experience in films of that caliber are lost in subsequent viewings.
2991
I was tricked into watching The Exorcist last night, and spent the first half-hour to hour of the film dreading the lack of sleep to follow.
2992
Yet.while it was still a bit disturbing, it wasn't in the frightening sense like it was for me when I viewed it 10 years ago.
2993
As for 28 Days Later, the London walk compilation is amazing even today.
2994
All of the empty streets without CGI and the soundtrack in the background.brilliant.
2995
Followed up by the chase and gas station scene, it has one of the strongest introductions in the horror genre.
2996
Seeing that raw take on "zombie"/epidemic media with fresh eyes again would be well worth it.
2997
the dark knight trilogy
2998
A Beautiful Mind - After you've seen it once it's never quite the same.
2999
Fight Club - Same reason.
3000
How has nobody said 'The sixth sense'.
3001
The twist in that movie was the most brilliant, unexpected film moments from the last 50 years.
3002
I remember when it came out people saying it would blow your mind.
3003
When I got around to see it I literally had goosebumps and just stared off into the credits in awe.
3004
It's neat watching again, seeing all the clues you missed, but nothing compares to the first time.
3005
The realization, the HOLY SHIT DID THAT JUST HAPPEN feeling, the shock that you had no idea it was coming, can never be duplicated.
3006
I've watched it more times than any other movie by far.I would love to sit down and watch it for the first time again.
3007
Alien, Aliens, Seven and The Usual Suspects would be on that list too.
3008
Super Troopers.
3009
Even though its hilarious every time I watch it, I will never laugh as much as I did the first time through.
3010
For me it would have to be The Game.
3011
Star Wars.
3012
My grandpa was a HUGE Star Wars fan and anything Sci Fi.
3013
So I never got that whole "Luke, I am your father" surprise.
3014
I had already seen it before I could comprehend.
3015
Usual suspects.
3016
The end still gives me chills and i know it is going to happen.
3017
I want to feel that again.
3018
Seven.
3019
I've got to say Children Of Men.
3020
The way I love to do things, from reading books, watching movies and playing video games is hear a little big.
3021
Whet my appetite, and go in with essentially no foreknowledge.
3022
And seeing that again for the first time.
3023
Just wowza.
3024
Where Eagles Dare
3025
127 Hours, for the amputation part.
3026
The first time I saw it in theaters and I seriously almost passed out in my seat.
3027
It was one of the most visceral experiences that I've ever had seeing a movie.

Don't Look Now.

probably coraline because how amazing it was with the stop motion and it was my first ever 3d film so i was blown away from that also
3031
No fight club yet?
3032
I can't imagine a director's cut would help that piece of shit movie.
3033
Yeah it was shit.
3034
I saw KoH In the cinema and hated that too, so I might be the wrong person to ask.
3035
Gladiator, however, is phenomenal.
3036
Ridley's Robin Hood, I really liked it, i forget which one i watched because i got it from netflix i while back but Ridley is one my favorite directors and i don't know why people didn't like RH, i thought it was really good in most aspects.
3037
It dragged on a bit but Ridley likes doing his long epics.
3038
I imagine people didn't think it was good because it changed the myth of Robin Hood.
3039
But Robin Hood is a myth, it's not known for certain whether Robin Hood is one man or many men, like a nickname given to criminals, Robin of the Hood became Robin Hood during that time which could have lent it self to the myths of great archery skills and all that jazz.
3040
I say watch and disregard people who can't give a constructive reason for not liking it.
3041
The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth make an excellent double feature.
3042
They are the perfect combination of period piece, horror and fantasy.
3043
I gave you an upvote, but I don't know if Jim Carrey can go into Jones' vocal range.
3044
The best part of the Joaquin Phoenix "Walk the Line" bio pic was he could actually pull of the singing.
3045
I couldn't remember what animal people called him (the possum).
3046
So, knowing it was wrong, I started calling him "The Badger".
3047
One of the only times I've made several people nearly piss themselves laughing.
3048
Competent storytelling.
3049
Lot of filmmakers still seem to find that problematic.
3050
Water (waves, sea foam, caustics, etc.) and fire.
3051
People in closeup.
3052
Fire is a big one.
3053
Cool little piece of trivia: Tarantino didn't think CGI fire was realistic enough so in Inglorious Basterds when Omar and the Bear are shooting the Germans in the burning movie theater, they actually set the set on fire.
3054
The fire got way out of control (so bad that the steel cables holding up the swastika melted) almost killing the two actors and causing one to faint after the scene.
3055
In that case. . .
3056
Dear Mr. Scott, I have only one thing to say "Please, for the love of good movies, don't Lucas your franchise.
3057
If you have to make shitty movies based on a stupid premise please, do so in a different universe.
3058
We, your fans, like the Aliens universe the way it is.
3059
Thanks."

3061
I'm pretty sure you can't top that one.
3062
I only talk about how much Nicolas Cage sucks.
3063
Sidenote: looking for legal ways to get the movies only, e.g.
3064
not via torrents.
3065
Until the movie industry fills this void, the only way to get an obscure movie is to download it illegally.
3066
You might be able to buy into a streaming site, but the chances of them having what you want are slim.
3067
I like to think that the massive trade disputes and animal rights disagreements that we saw happen at the end of Happy Feet eventually led to the Oil Wars that mark the beginning of the Mad Max trilogy.
3068
Daredevil and the teenage mutant ninja turtles are created in the same comic.
3069
It's a little circlejerky, I've always thought the Tarantino universe is pretty cool.
3070
I had written this for a friend a few months ago: So, I stumbled across the Tommy Westphall Universe Hypotheses today and it blew my mind.
3071
There was a TV show called St. Elsewhere, which aired when I was a kid (1982 - 1988).
3072
It was a hospital drama show that my parents watched.
3073
In the series finale, "The Last One", the camera shows an exterior shot of the hospital, St. Eligius, with snow beginning to fall.
3074
Now, instead of the end credits, the show cuts to an apartment where there is a child (later identified as Tommy Westphall) playing with a snow globe.
3075
We see his father, who was a Doctor in the hospital come home from his construction job and another Doctor from the hospital.
3076
The adults talk and it turns out they are not Doctors and also that Tommy is autistic.
3077
Based on the father's conversation, Tommy, just sits silently shaking the globe "in his own world" all day.
3078
The father wonders what is going on inside his mind.
3079
Tommy is told to come eat dinner.
3080
The father shakes the snow globe and places it on the television.
3081
The camera pans in to show a building inside the snow globe, which is St. Eligius, the hospital from the show.
3082
Here is where this gets interesting!
3083
There is this theory that the whole entire series/show was all inside the mind of this autistic boy, Tommy.
3084
I think this is a very cool way to end a show, much like the ending to Newhart, where we find out it was 'all a dream'.
3085
Now, if you believe the world of St.
3086
Elsewhere took place in Tommy's mind, then there are also hundreds of shows in the Tommy Westphall multiverse.
3087
Within television shows and films, there are several shows that exists in the same universe.
3088
A good example of this is Everybody Loves Raymond and The Kind of Queens.
3089
The main characters of both shows have appeared on the others show.
3090
Well, there were two characters from St. Elsewhere that appeared on the TV show Homicide: Life on the Street, hence, showing these two shows belong to the same universe.
3091
Since Homicide: Life on the Street, is now part of the Tommy's universe, we can include several other shows based on Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer), who not only appeared on several of the Law & Order spinoffs, but also: The Wire, The X-Files, Arrested Development, and The Beat.
3092
If you believe in the Tommy Westphall multiverse, are all shows with a connection to St. Elsewhere inside of this boys head?
3093
This is very cool to think about, right?
3094
Even if you do not have a character crossover onto another show, you can have one character mention a fictional place, item, brand, etc, to connect shows into Tommy's mind.
3095
There is a very cool chart and list of how all these shows are connected back to the original show (St.
3096
Elsewhere) linked below.
3097
There are a few hundred shows and counting to Tommy's multiverse.

Blade Runner/Soldier
3100
My friend was telling me that the law and orders, the wire, and the x files were in the same universe because of : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JohnMunch
3101
The problem with looking at things like this is that often the director/some on the crew just decides "this would be funny if" - it's like saying that Indiana Jones is the same universe as Star Wars after that post last week with the C3PO and R2D2 hieroglyphics.
3102
It appears that all of the Marvel Studios' films released in the past 5 years, (IronMan,Thor, etc.) have been in the same universe.
3103
If they had all the heroes team up in a tie-in film, they would make some serious cash.
3104
It turns out that you can make a really good case for just about all western TV being set in the same universe
3105
Here's a good post on the Tarantino universe.
3106
I think this is the one I watched and liked but I can't be sure Kuch Naa Kaho (2003)
3107
ManMadeMoon: &#91;2012/08/27&#93;&#91;01:14:51&#93; &#91;Translate&#93;: I think all Dutch men secretly think they are Roy Batty.
3108
&#91;This comment was posted by a bot&#93;&#91;FAQ&#93;&#91;Did I get it wrong?&#93;
3109
I've watched a few American TV shows and I've concluded almost everyone seems to come from New York or New Jersey.
3110
Are you dumb?
3111
Noun, probably because the sequel is called Aliens.
3112
The idea that a work of art, or even a title can have a singular interpretation or meaning is somewhat facile.
3113
It's a great title because of it's layers.
3114
I see the 'alien' theme woven throughout the film in all manner of ways.
3115
There are the obvious aliens like the creature, the space jockey, the eggs, and there are also literal alien constructs like the planet, the derelict ship, the message, etc.
3116
Then there's the things that are more metaphorically alien like the Corporation, Mother, and especially Ash.
3117
But for me one of the most subtle, but most powerful running themes is that the characters are constantly encountering alien situations.
3118
There's the classism between the crew, best exemplified when when Ripley goes below into Bret's and Parker's 'world' to discuss repairs, and when there is a sense which is palpable for all three that she doesn't belong there.
3119
Then too there's that dreadful sense of unfamiliarity with his own ship that Dallas faces while in the ducts.
3120
That sense of unknown, coupled with the knowledge that there is indeed a monster hiding in the shadows, makes Dallas "wanna get out of here", want to run from that strange place.
3121
Finally, there's the struggle that each character undergoes when faced with situations, with decisions, that are utterly alien to them.
3122
This can be seen in their indecision on how to deal with the creature, their stress building and building.
3123
These are people who are capable sailors, educated, licensed officers and crew, but who are in a situation for which they have no frame of reference, where none of that helps.
3124
This sense of 'alien-ness', of being completely lost, doesn't require that there happen to be a literal alien creature aboard.
3125
Perhaps my favourite example of the crew dealing with such an alien situation is when Ash has to kill Ripley.
3126
The struggle he faces as he decides that Ripley is a threat to the mission, a priority to be rescinded, is incredibly powerful.
3127
The look on his face when he has Ripley held down and searches for a means to destroy her is both utterly perplexed and chillingly haunted.
3128
It's an outstanding performance by Holm, one of my favourite moments in the film.
3129
Silence of the Lambs
3130
The Mist.
3131
It was fairly spot on with the book until the ending, which was better than what King wrote.
3132
Of course, I love movies with endings like that.
3133
Shawshank redemption
3134
r/tipofmytongue
3135
I can never get enough Pan's Labyrinth.
3136
Woah, no love for Cronos?
3137
It is such a touching story, and Ron Perlman is at his finest.
3138
Both hellboy movies are not bad, bu I'm interested in his new movie called pacific rim.
3139
At the mountains of madness :(
3140
Blade II as it introduced me to the wonderful world of Guillermo Del Torro and his films.All the films he has directed so far have been top notch material and I've got high hopes that Pacific Rim will turn out to be terrific
3141
Tie between Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth.
3142
I love both movies.
3143
12 Monkeys or 13 assassins.
3144
Just two movies with consecutive numbers that popped in my head.
3145
Fracture is a good thriller with Anthony Hopkins Kingdom of heaven is a good epic action movie Troy is good too I've heard Warrior is also surprisingly good Edit: I use the word good way too much
3146
"Jet Li's Fearless" is pretty good
3147
David Bowie as captain planet
3148
No he tossed it in for them.
3149
Don Cheadle as Capt.
3150
Planet.
3151
The other's can be whoever.
3152
Bhargav Dronamraju for Ma-ti.
3153
Ma-Ti (The one with the Heart ring) would have to be played by Wilmer Valderrama, because everything about that character is worthless.
3154
The fact that prolifers think about it that way doesn't negate the fact that rapist think about the plank in the Republican Party Platform opposing abortion in all cases with no exception for rape as enabling rapists to choose the mother of their child.
3155
That is the effect of the Akin Plank.
3156
That's simply a matter of fact.
3157
If you don't like rapists to be able to have children with anyone they choose, and even get parental rights, then don't vote Republican.
3158
The issue is that the Republicans think women should not care about their own rights.
3159
Where did you get the batshit crazy idea that nobody thought men shouldn't vote for them either?
3160
You're frustrated because the facts are not on the side of your opinion.
3161
So change your opinion, because the facts are not changing, they're just true.
3162
Either address the issues, or stop talking crazy shit.
3163
The issue is that Republicans hate women, so they're waging a war on them.
3164
Do you agree or disagree?
3165
If you disagree, then prove it: how do you explain the fact that Akin's crazy beliefs are a plank of the Republican party platform?
3166
So you agree with Akin and Ryan and Romney, and you disagree with these women.
3167
Sounds like you are the one who hates these women, and all others.
3168
I'm glad reddit's still found a way to hate these women.
3169
And a higher percent would rather cut worthless Government spending.
3170
What's frustrating for me is the idea that taxes are some sort of membership fee and this Robin Hood idea of take from the "rich" and give to the poor.
3171
Taxes carried on the middle class are ridiculous.
3172
My parents combined income was a little under 200K and they paid 60K in taxes.
3173
That's fucking ridiculous.
3174
The goverment does not deserve that much money from each middle class family.
3175
My family worked hard for that money and the last person 30% of their income should go to is the government.
3176
Also, i've seen way too many people (in Southern California, at least) abuse the system from wellfare, unemployment and other programs.
3177
They brag about it!
3178
In fact I've met more people who have abused the system than actually use it as a stepping stone.
3179
While i'm a registered Republican, i'm really not (mostly because i'm not a social conservative by any definition).
3180
Nor am I a democrat, libertarian or any other party.
3181
I extremely dislike Obama and Romney.
3182
The government is too damn big to be effective and in my experience too many people are content with the "gimmee gimme gimmee" mentality.
3183
NOTHING is free.
3184
Someone is always footing the bill and unfortunately it's the middle class who many consider to be the rich a-holes not paying enough taxes.
3185
Obviously there are people hurting despite extrodinary effort to get themselves back on track in this economy and sometimes people truly do need help but many people could succeed if they tried.
3186
It might not be the most glorious job but hell it's a job and you should be happy you are doing your part in helping the economy.
3187
That's what I did.
3188
Some of my points aren't as fluid as I would like them to be, but this is incredibly frustrating and there's so much more I'd like to say.
3189
My verbal diarrhea will be lost in comments anyway.
3190
/end rant Edit: spelling
3191
The majority of Americans aren't "the wealthy" so.
3192
no shit?
3193
No shit?
3194
A majority of Americans aren't wealthy either.
3195
Majority rule is generally a bad idea.
3196
The majority of Americans aren't wealthy.Why is this a big deal?
3197
Of course most people are going to want someone else carry the burden.
3198
This is like saying, "the majority of Americans don't want to pay taxes, but they want free services".
3199
A majority of Americans are not wealthy.
3200
Our safety net has been attacked by the super wealthy who have accumulated vast fortunes by tax policy and helping themselves to our budgets.
3201
They just resent other people doing it.
3202
And my response is duh.
3203
no fucking shit I would
3204
Government isn't bad politicians are bad.
3205
We just need to elect the right people.
3206
This headline seems like an Onion headline.
3207
So obviouis.
3208
And me too CommonsCarnival!
3209
They basically want themselves to be shot in the foot.
3210
That's because a majority of Americans aren't wealthy.
3211
"A majority of Americans would rather see higher taxes on the wealthy before cuts are made to public services such as food safety and border security" This is front page material?
3212
I would think this is a pretty universal opinion of everyones lol
3213
The "wealthy's" taxes are high enough!
3214
congratulations, you used logical thinking.yyyyaaaaaaayyyyy
3215
Right because border security and immigration is a big priority of this administration.
3216
Oh no!
3217
We must protect America's precious wealthy.
3218
One wealthy person is worth 100 ordinary underfunded people.
3219
Even mentioning the word "taxation" in their presence would cause them to get a vicious attack of the vapors.
3220
If a child must go without a food stamps or a decent public education, then so be it.
3221
Now, take this awful, terrible article down immediately before some rich person accidentally reads it.
3222
A majority of Americans won't get off their asses and vote in primaries.
3223
lol, what border security?
3224
Do you want a government worker who's pay is not dependent on reducing them amount of care provided between you and your doctor or do you want a private corporation worker who's pay might be tied to reducing care and the company itself's profits depending up reducing care between you and your doctor?
3225
Kind of like Obama and his support for closing Gitmo and ending war that way, isn't he.
3226
obama & romney are crap-when can we move away from this 2 party system.
3227
It doesn't have to be between just 2 people!
3228
And those primaries are bullshit
3229
As a doctor, even though Medicare and Medicaid reimburse less than private insurance companies, I'm happy when I need to order a CT or MRI and I see that the pt has Medicare or Medicaid, because I know that I'll actually be able to order the test hat I need.
3230
All the insurance companies make us jump through ridiculous hoops, like making multiple phone calls, holding for 45 minuts, "accidentally" hanging up on us after holding for long periods of time, and the like.
3231
It's obvious that insurance companies are purposely obstructive.
3232
I can even tell ahead of time which insurance companies will deny specific surgeries.
3233
What doctor has extra time to deal with these sorts of obstacles?
3234
The insurance companies are banking on he fact that doctors will eventually give up, saving the companies money.
3235
I am Canadian and can attest to this, I am also an American, I lived in Canada for 8 years and had one of my children there, great care, no waiting, no problems, lots of choice.
3236
I also had cancer testing and other medical issues there and again no problems.
3237
Here in California where I live now, we used to be insured by Blue Cross.
3238
Many years of premiums and no claims, then my daughter had three medical situations and after the third one they dropped her.
3239
When we asked why they shamelessly told us that she had exceeded the amount of claims in a given period and was considered a risk, we had to find a separate insurance for her which was very difficult at that point.
3240
This is a terrible system and needs dramatic reform.
3241
I never understood people who make the argument about not wanting "a bureaucrat between you and your doctor" -- looking and you, Republicans.
3242
Of course there's a bureaucrat -- she's in a cubicle at Blue Cross, and she's been there since Nixon put her there.
3243
This is what is happening to my best friend at the moment.
3244
About a year ago, she had a lump on her shoulder that she wanted to get checked out.
3245
She went to the doctor and got a biopsy and about a week later got back on her mom's insurance.
3246
Well the biopsy came back showing that she had a rare type of lymphoma, but the insurance company denied her coverage on any related costs due to it being a "pre-existing condition".
3247
Thankfully, Obamacare and the Leukemia and Lymphoma society came to the rescue and she was able to get treatments.
3248
Now she has a new job that comes with health insurance, and she's started to have some new issues that the doctors think may be related to her lymphoma.
3249
Her insurance company has now told her that she cannot see her original lymphoma doctor due to "lack of medical necessity" (regardless of the referral from her primary care physician), and are forcing her to wait months for an appointment with the "in network" doctor.
3250
They have also denied her coverage on her uterine biopsy because she went to a doctor out of network.
3251
TL;DR: Insurance companies are fucktards and are dicking around with my best friend's health!
3252
The insurance companies can do whatever they frickin' want.
3253
What we all need is a public option to get our insurance from the government.
3254
Medicare has far lower administrative costs than private insurance: insurance companies spend about 17 percent while Medicare spends about 2 percent.
3255
That executive pay is pure waste as far as the patients are concerned, and if Americans had the opportunity to buy into a public option, the corporations would lose most of their captive customers.
3256
The corporations know this and so they bribe the politicians to prevent it.
3257
I tell people that no matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, if you could spend a year under the universal free health care system they have in Canada or England or France, you would never never never want to go back to the overcomplicated, expensive, unfair mess we have here.
3258
NEVER.
3259
there's no problem with having insurance companies.
3260
It's just having insurance companies in the US healthcare system where everything goes to shit.
3261
The focus is profit maximization under a cost minimization constraint.
3262
Cut coverage, raise rates, and deny requests after substantial review.
3263
Once payouts do occur, raise premiums to mitigate liability.
3264
What every civilized state in the world does instead is health maximization under constraint of cost minimization.
3265
You compete on making operations efficient while having to cover everyone.
3266
If you can't do it, you're undercut and go out of business.
3267
There are of course systems where insurers pay a purely secondary role because healthcare is state-sponsored and focused on preventative medicine rather than treatments.
3268
Overall the system in the US is designed to get money and who cares that people go bankrupt or die as a result.
3269
This is a simplification but it's not hyperbolic.
3270
Why do Americans keep supporting the Health Insurance industry, to the tune of Billions of profit per year?
3271
They are making money from your neighbors and your ill.
3272
This is one of the most screwed up things about the U.S
3273
I'm sorry but the US put your health and medical facilities in the hands of businesses.
3274
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU PEOPLE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN!Insurance companies don't take any medical oath, the only oath they take is to make money.
3275
fyi, obama's healthcare bill is a huge, HUGE boon to insurance companies.
3276
you are now legally forced to use their product
3277
It's actually a standard republican tactic, turning strengths into weaknesses and weaknesses into strengths.
3278
Look at what they are doing with the 700 billion in medicare savings that Obama wrought with his ACA they call it a cut, as if services will be cut, rather than waste and over payments being cut.
3279
Look at what they did when Obama sued ohio to allow early voting for everyone, not just the largest republican voting block:the military.
3280
The right accused him of trying to suppress the military vote.
3281
They cry and point to the dems about the debt and deficit THAT THEY RAN UP.
3282
Heck look what they are doing to obama over osama and he didnt even send a carrier out to sea so he could land on it in a military jumpsuit as if he had been at war the entire time.
3283
which is exactly why we needed a law against insurance companies cutting off sick people - which is part of the ACA health reform bill - and i fucking guarantee you when these GOP-for life moron baby boomers start getting prostate cancer at 65 they will become democrats in a hell fire hurry when they figure out that rush limbaugh was lying to them the entire time and the ACA was actually a great thing for them.
3284
Ignorant fucking cunts - the lot of them are.
3285
America, if you blokes makes Mitt your president, I truly lose hope in you.
3286
I gave you a pass when voting Bush in for second term, but now is the last straw.
3287
Don't blow it.
3288
Yeah, the insurance companies are death panels.
3289
They're also for profit tax collectors with no responsibility to those being taxed.
3290
A mandatory insurance law forces me to buy insurance.
3291
The payment comes directly from my paycheck.
3292
That's the same to me as a tax.
3293
The difference is that an insurer has no responsibility to me.
3294
They only see a chance to collect as much money as possible and pay out as little as possible.
3295
Feels like taxation without representation to me.
3296
Oh wang-banger, you've done it again.
3297
Photo caption on that page: Romney: I'm Good for Women Hey, Mitt, the word is that every woman will be making the judgement for herself about whether you are 'Good for Women' or not, and there's no need for you to presume that you need to make it for them.
3298
Right now most women are judging that you're NOT good for them, so stop lying to us, already.
3299
I work for an insurance company.
3300
I can confirm this.
3301
Yeah, but it's OK because the government doesn't control the panels, corporations do.
3302
We can trust corporations, they are people just like us.
3303
This is so obvious if you stop to think about it.
3304
The whole reason the death panels propaganda works is fear mongering among the people who dislike the government being in charge of our lives.
3305
The whole Republican platform relies on vilifying the Federal government while claiming corporations are people too.
3306
The "death Panels do exist, just now they are hidden in the insurance companies, out of view.
3307
Had a Co-worker years ago who got seriously ill, and spent five days in the hospital.
3308
at the end of the fifth day she was sent home because "she had maxed out her Hospital coverage" and they wouldn't pay for more.
3309
(and this was a big co.
3310
I forget which one, but think it was a Blue Cross subsidiary) She died that night.
3311
The ultimate problem is the concept.of
3312
health "insurance."
3313
Insurance is simply gambling - you are betting that someday your house will burn or your car will get damaged, and the insurance.company
3314
is betting agsinst it.
3315
Many people go their entire lives paying for insurance and never using it.
3316
The difference with health insurance is that every single person will eventually use it, so there is no gamble.
3317
That means that the insurance companies have to stack the deck, refuse certain players, or just cheat.
3318
We should look more at health care as a health care "management" system, in which patients get the treatment they require and costs are controlled.
3319
Insurance companies which have a profit motive aren't in the best position to do that.
3320
Ultimately, the only system that really makes sense is a goverment-controlled single payer system in which profit is not an issue, proper care is the issue.
3321
The fact remains that Medicare and Medicaid work well, but there are numerous problems.such
3322
as faud and waste that need to be seriously addressed, as well as funding.
3323
However, all of those problems could be easily controlled.
3324
We simply have to make choice about how we will spend our tax revenues.
3325
For one thing, I am willing to give less corporate welfare to enormously profitable multinational corporations.
3326
We could raise more revenues by forcing the wealhy and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.
3327
We could encourage the return of decently paying manufacturig jobs to America by giving breaks to cooperative companies and taxing unccoperative copanies, ths stimulating both the tax base and the economy.
3328
The bottom line is that there should be no such thing as health insurance, and profit-motivated companies should be removed from the position of deciding who lives, who suffers and who dies, with their only decidimg factor being how much it is going to cost them or make for them.
3329
Changing the definitions of words is the GOPd M.O.; rape, liberty, death panels and the like, it's their thing
3330
Insurance is a legalized mafia protection racket.
3331
It is the cause of, not the solution to our broken health care system.
3332
Speaking from experience: I was born with a genetic disorder.
3333
This disorder can, and will, kill you if it goes untreated and based on the luck of the draw you can get the less severe (non-existent) one where you can live your life normally or you could be horribly disfigured and crippled.
3334
I spent most of my childhood in the hospital.
3335
My father and mother fought tooth and nail to get me and my sister (with the same disorder, but worse) to the best genetics doctors in the world as well as all the best lung, heart, and development doctors.
3336
I kid you not when I say an average month for me was between 10-20 doctors appointments.
3337
Most of these were exploratory as me and my sister are two of the "best cases" you can have with this disease.
3338
We've even been featured in medical magazines.
3339
Largely thanks to my mother and father fighting the insurance companies were unable to deny us coverage for potentially life saving treatment.
3340
Now, flash forward 8 years to today (I'm 22) where I've grown out of the disorder.
3341
I ended up getting the unlucky end of the stick on other health problems.
3342
I need medication for a few conditions I have and I have to spend some time with some really expensive doctors and do some really expensive tests.
3343
About a year before Obama's healthcare plan came out the insurance company cut me.
3344
They denied me coverage on anything and eventually removed me from the policy stating that "I was too old".
3345
I was 19 and going to school full time and work part time.
3346
The only option was COBRA.
3347
COBRA sucks.
3348
Imagine you, barely able to afford anything, and COBRA takes all your money.
3349
That's what happened.
3350
With the help of my mother and father I was able to cover myself with COBRA for two months at the cost of $6000 USD.
3351
They didn't cover my medication, which cost me an addition $230 out of pocket and the co-pay I had to pay to see my doctor was close to $100.
3352
I gave up, fell into depression, and started preparing to die young.
3353
I was raised being told that I'd never get health insurance in America and the second I can I should move somewhere better.
3354
America isn't a country for people unfortunate enough to be born down on their luck.
3355
To the fat-cat American, I should've died 19 years ago.
3356
Then Obamacare came.
3357
The walls for pre-existing came down and I was able to get covered again.
3358
Now, my only problem is getting into my doctors office as I'm busy trying to get my life back on track.
3359
I can get regular medicine and regular check ups.
3360
I'm not going broke paying out of pocket, and best of all I can stay in America (not that I really want to anyway.) and keep going to school.
3361
Thankfully, Obamacare came before I left the country for good.
3362
I would've never met my beautiful girlfriend and I would've never chose the major I did.
3363
The truth is all these insurance companies care about is two things: The shareholders and the bottom line.
3364
Sick people cut into their profits.
3365
They would rather see you die and pocket the difference than do anything to help you.
3366
They're the modern day robber-barons of the Industrial Age.
3367
Under no circumstance will these mentally ill people do anything to keep their contract obligations.
3368
I, and many others, would LOVE to see the executive boards of these health insurance companies hanged on live TV for their crimes.
3369
No one deserves to promise anyone better health and then turn around, after they've contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to them, and tell them "no, sorry, we can't".
3370
I hope this story helps.
3371
I absolutely can't stand insurance companies, I can't stand the people that think healthcare in other nations is "socialism", and I can't stand the bottom-line thinking MBA trust fund fuckwads telling me what's "right" for my health.
3372
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go throw up.
3373
So if we didn't have insurance companies how would all this work out?
3374
Would I be paying more or less than now
3375
I had the audacity to get sick shortly after being laid off work.
3376
Found a temp job while looking for something more permanent when it happened.
3377
My illness required surgery (two actually) and the temp job did not include medical.
3378
Had to work that job and really step up my search.
3379
Meanwhile getting worse and unable to stand upright anymore.
3380
Temp job (in medical field) lost due to my looking sick (not job performance).I finally found a permanent job with medical.
3381
Had to wait 6 months to be able to use it and it cost me almost 1/2 of my income.
3382
16 months of 24hr.
3383
a day outrageous pain.
3384
I admit that I am the working poor and such is my lot.
3385
I am now again in a job with no medical.
3386
Unless I can bootstrap myself into a better tax bracket should I get sick again I would death panel myself rather than deal with that again.
3387
I am on a medication at a higher than approved dose.
3388
It's pretty much the only thing keeping me functioning at the moment.
3389
My employer switched from Blue Cross to United, and now I am not "approved" to take that medication anymore.
3390
I am starting to get sick again, thanks to United Healthcare deciding I should't be allowed to take my medication at the Dr. approved dosage.
3391
There's a difference between denying coverage and denying actually letting you get a procedure done.
3392
Wouldn't' it be great if there was a bill that forced us all to pay them or face legal penalties?
3393
That would just be swell.
3394
Aren't there rules about editorializing headlines in this subreddit?
3395
But it's private industry doing it, so, what's the problem?
3396
I agree with most of the poster here, but I think there is a more important question.
3397
When you use health care where does all the money go.
3398
12 years ago my mother went for medical care for an infected fingernail.
3399
Medicare was billed $1000 for maybe 30 minutes of care.
3400
Why the fuck did it cost this much?
3401
I think that's the real problem.
3402
Yet, I see none of our 'representatives' addressing this question.
3403
Tort reform is an official topic of the 2012 Republican Platform.
3404
Instead of addressing medical cost reform they are suggesting cost can be kept down by preventing recovery from medical malpractice.
3405
Seems a big backward to me.
3406
Tort reform has done nothing to keeps costs down where it has been enacted and the medical establishment keeps finding ways to bleed us dry.edit: iphone mistakes
3407
There will be in any system.
3408
Scarcity means that you need to ration.
3409
Anyone who doesn't acknowledge this is a conman.
3410
The question is how do you conduct the rationing.
3411
The 2 broad methods we have tried are using experts and by revealed preference.
3412
Many people confuse the health care system with the health insurance system.
3413
This is a classic source of funds/ use of funds mistake.
3414
I don't think anyone thinks the current insurance system is working well, nor do I think anyone who has read obamacare legislation think that it will be good.
3415
There will be no improvement on the insurance system side while it is interconnected with the labour market.
3416
I don't understand how anyone could think that a company that sells yoghurt or cars could be relied on to make decisions health insurance.
3417
Im not sure the health care system itself is working poorly, sure it can be improved.
3418
The problem is that medicare & medicaid have problems making payments to doctors.
3419
Are you seriously linking to an article whose first sentence compares Mitt Romney's and Paul Ryan's healthcare policy to 1984?
3420
The difference is that I can sue the shit out of an insurance company if they wrongly deny coverage.
3421
If the government does so I am shit out of luck, sovereign immunity and all that.
3422
An ant forager doesn't return unless and until it finds something.
3423
In other words, succeed or die trying.
3424
Nature has its inviolate rules for every individual to follow, from the smallest to the largest, 'tis clear.
3425
I see a lot of comments along the lines of "Don't agree completely but I respect him" or "he seems to be honest."
3426
comments.
3427
Do these same people agree completely and/or respect Romney or Obama?
3428
Honesty from and respect for a candidate but not good enough for a vote?
3429
What the heck is that about?
3430
These people prefer a dishonest and disrespectful candidate because they have a chance to win?
3431
That is the most important thing?
3432
Good on him Speaking under those conditions would have been a pyrrhic victory.
3433
His legacy is in the ideas he has popularized.
3434
I think hey are maybe drawing bigger conclusions than warranted by the data Maybe the explanation is simpler- such as.
3435
A forager won't return to the nest until it finds food.
3436
If seeds are plentiful, foragers return faster, and more ants leave the nest to forage.
3437
If, however, ants begin returning empty handed, the search is slowed, and perhaps called off.
3438
"'I.fully endorse Mitt Romney for President' - Ron Paul" - Mitt Romney Campaign
3439
I don't agree with a lot of Ron Paul's policies but he's honest, and I'll give him that.
3440
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH RON PAUL, BUT
3441
A republican with integrity?
3442
I may not agree with RP on everything; but I certainly respect him - and I know exactly where he stands on issues.
3443
"Fuck you Mitt"-Ron Paul
3444
Here's the thing about the Ron Paul movement: while I disagree with a lot of his positions, I don't think he or his followers are evil or morally wrong.
3445
I just disagree.
3446
In my experience, Paul followers reciprocate.
3447
They have strong feelings about the Constitution and government, but they do not generally fall into the trap of Good vs Evil that is so common in the Republican party.
3448
Ergo, I sincerely hope that Paul and his followers either bend the Republicans toward their style of discourse or start a new party that is successful enough to get people elected to positions at all levels.
3449
Ron Paul is the only candidate I've seen who, at least 90% of the time, tells you what he actually thinks as opposed to what he thinks you want to hear.
3450
(Romney is the ultimate example of the latter.)
3451
I wish more politicians had that quality.
3452
This shouldn't be a surprise; the Republican party would never allow an old school conservative go up their and speak his mind on the parties biggest platform.
3453
Ron Paul has more in common with progressives like Dennis Kucinich than he does with neoconservatives like Mitt Romney.
3454
Sadly, that's not even an attempt at humor.
3455
Ron Paul and Ralph Nader agree on Libertarian - Progressive alliance against corporatism They're commited to be anti-war, anti-PATRIOT ACT, want to audit the Fed, reform our foreign policy, they were united against the bailouts, they both oppose corporate subsidies, etc.
3456
I support somebody who had lunch with Kucinich every day in Washington to win the republican nomination.
3457
Also Paul acknowledges the war on whistleblowers and the war on Drugs unlike 99% of the other politicians.
3458
I don't always agree with Ron Paul, but I hate it when rivals just roll on their backs and support each other "for the good of the party."
3459
You go, Ron Paul!
3460
what i'd do to see an honest man running for president
3461
Hahaha fuck the RNC.
3462
I'll just vote for Gary Johnson, why the fuck would I vote for Mittens?
3463
How insecure is Mitt Romney that he requires editorial approval of everyone's speeches?
3464
His speech should be: "I endorse MITT for President" pregnant pause "OF THE DOG CATCHERS ASSOCIATION, THE ONLY OFFICE HE IS FIT TO HOLD"
3465
WHY CANT THIS GUY BE OUR CANDIDATE?
3466
WHO THE FUCK VOTED FOR ROMNEY?
3467
Please endorse Gary Johnson then.
3468
On Reddit, it is cool to say "I don't agree with Ron Paul, but I respect him."
3469
ITT "I disagree with 2/3 of pauls policies, but hes so brave"
3470
An important note: His son, Rand Paul, will be speaking at the RNC.
3471
If the Paul family wants to deliver a message to America at the RNC, this is how it's going to happen.
3472
Rand Paul: The Kentucky senator is the heir ?
3473
literally and figuratively ? to the libertarian-tinged Republicanism of his father, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.).
3474
With Ron Paul stepping away from politics later this year ? he is retiring from his House seat ?
3475
Rand Paul’s convention speech will be regarded by many Paul-ites as an official passing of the torch from father to son.
3476
The central question in Rand Paul’s speech will be whether he stays on the Romney team’s preferred messages or begins building his own case for 2016 /2020.
3477
Already there is controversy surrounding the Paul family; Ron Paul told the New York Times that he doesn’t “fully endorse?
3478
Romney for president and turned down an opportunity to speak at the convention.
3479
Does Rand Paul stay loyal to the presidential nominee or the paterfamilias?
3480
WP
3481
The GOP Convention is going to air a "tribute" to Ron Paul.
3482
I wonder how they're going to introduce it.
3483
Perhaps it will go something like this: All right, all right everyone!
3484
This next video is a tribute to a man who couldn't be here tonight.
3485
because we told him he couldn't.
3486
but we want all of his supporters to feel welcome here in the Republican Party.
3487
even though we told them they couldn't come either.
3488
Anyway, here's our tribute to Ron Paul! Whooooooo!
3489
In 2008 I thought RP was crazy.
3490
In 2012 I think RP is the only one who isn't crazy.
3491
Ayn Rand Rand Paul Ron Paul Paul Ryan Ashley Ryan WTF
3492
if a person who has gotten so many votes can not even speak at the convention to speak his mind , doesnt it remind you the chinese and soviet style political culture
3493
Why are some people acting so surprised?
3494
Ron Paul's policies aren't even the definition of the modern day Republican party anyway.
3495
I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I like Ron Paul a lot more than I do Mitt Romney
3496
Ron Paul is such a boss.
3497
A lot of the comments here start out with some variation of "I don't support Ron Paul but." Please explain why you don't support Ron Paul so that the Paul supporters here know what they're dealing with.
3498
Oh, Reddit.
3499
Wouldn't you have much rather had an Obama/Paul debate then an Obama/Romney one?
3500
Sad there was so much vitriol against a man whose primary goals were to end the wars and live within our means.
3501
You'll never get that with either Obama or Romney.
3502
Be nicer to Gary Johnson, Reddit.
3503
God could you imagine if Ron Paul endorsed Romney?
3504
All of Reddit would collectively shit it's pants and cry simultaneously.
3505
I'm tired of the election being framed as Romney vs. Obama.
3506
Gary Johnson 2012.
3507
Thank you Ron Paul for paving the way for libertarianism and inspiring me to vote.
3508
Really hoping that he runs as an independent.
3509
Long shot though.
3510
What a consistent, principled person.
3511
This is why I like Ron Paul: I don't agree with everything he has to say, but I know he's not going to put his finger to the wind -- ever -- just to get what he wants.
3512
Even at the end of his political career, he still remains the most consistent politician.
3513
Although people love him or hate him, why does everyone not see him for the one politician that shook the establishment.
3514
What he said 30 years ago, he still stands by it today, we need more people like him, regardless of political standing, who you know where they stand on the issues at all times.
3515
I don't like Ron Paul's policies, but I admire his tenacity and how he sticks to his convictions.
3516
Imaginary high five to Dr. Paul.
3517
It all comes down to the vote.
3518
Votes mean absolutely nothing until we come up with an alternative voting system.
3519
I'd vote Obama first, Ron Paul second.
3520
there's at least one republican that thinks for himself!
3521
Libertarians should make a clean break from the Republicans.
3522
Ron Paul isn't a flip-floping, establishment sellout, "Unquestionable Support for Israel", Zionist douche-bag like Romney.
3523
50% of the comments here: "I don't agree with Ron Paul's policies but "
3524
SO BRAVE.
3525
At first I read "Ron Paul" as "Paul Ryan" and was pretty shocked!
3526
Still a good article though.
3527
Floor fight please!
3528
I would never vote for Ron Paul, but I think it's great that he's sticking for what he believes in.
3529
Personally, I'm voting for Jill Stein of the Green Party this year.
3530
If he really gave a shit about running against the establishment, how come Ron Paul never once attacked Mitt Romney in any of the GOP debates?
3531
I don't care if Paul speaks or not.
3532
I just want to see the big-budget video tributes to Nixon, Agnew, Bush and Cheney.
3533
Oh, never mind, that's right, those inconvenient shitbags aren't going to be mentioned either.
3534
Just the holy Reagan.
3535
IF you live in a solid Obama or solid Romney state - please vote third party regardless of your beliefs.
3536
We need solid choices like Ron Paul to be allowed to run on an equal footing.
3537
Gov. Johnson for president then.
3538
Or any 3rd party.
3539
just make sure your vote for "other" is counted!
3540
The Republican Party machine did not want Ron Paul to speak in the first place.
3541
Looks like they got what they wanted.
3542
I don't support him, but at least he has chutzpah.
3543
This is why Ron Paul is one of the only politicians I can support as a real conservative that actually believes in small government.
3544
I have a lot of respect for Ron Paul.
3545
If all politicians were as honest as him we would be living in a much better country.
3546
Thank you Ron Paul for being so honest and doing what you feel is right.
3547
The GOP has treated you terribly.
3548
I hope this makes Mittens look even worse in the eyes of any of his potential voters.
3549
You know, I think it would be a masterstroke for the Obama campaign to independently arrange a debate with Ron Paul.
3550
It would be the one substantive debate of the election cycle, and it would make crystal clear how airheaded the Republican talking points are.
3551
Hell, I don't fully endorse Mitt Romney to clean my toilets.
3552
SO BRAVE
3553
Am I the only one that has a problem with the fact that the GOP just decided something for the American people?
3554
I know it happens all the time but this is pretty in our face
3555
I don't fully endorse Mitt Romney What the hell does that mean anyway?
3556
I'm not a Paulite, but I respect what he's doing here.
3557
Am I the only person who doesn't understand why he repeatedly stays aligned with a party that doesn't give a fuck about him?
3558
If he would just run as a third party independent or Libertarian he could be one of the most viable third party candidates we have ever seen.
3559
Fucking RNC has tried so hard to keep him from speaking, theyve tried to change like 3 rules i fucking hate them
3560
I dont agree with Obama, but I dont trust or respect Romney.
3561
Ron Paul has my vote
3562
Interesting article.
3563
Seems like the subtext is this: Republican Party to democracy: consume feces and expire.
3564
Thought top comment would be "So brave".
3565
Was disapointed.
3566
Not a Paul supporter however, I know that he was running and telling him he has to endorse his opponent fully is just bad karma imo
3567
It's bad that they ask someone to speak but say they need to review what he is going to say.
3568
He probably wouldn't say a single bad thing about Romney, but offer his opinion on what he should do as president.
3569
i don't care much for paul, but i do like his consistency.
3570
can't say that for most politicians.
3571
policies and governing ideas that i don't understand aside, ron paul has my vote for being a man whom i don't feel disgust towards when reading his political news.
3572
People often accuse the Republicans of being unified.
3573
I think they are just controlled.
3574
Wow, the NY Times really buried that fact -- it's way down inside a story not mentioned at all on their front page.
3575
I'm not going to vote this year.
3576
If I end up voting, i am going to write in John Smith.
3577
"There's a lot of luck in politics."
3578
-Ron Paul Way to be, Mr. Paul.
3579
There's a lot of luck in everything.
3580
Kudos for recognizing it even during bright days.
3581
Too many people fall into the trap of crediting everything to their skills.
3582
Local card carrying conservative radio host in my town: The number one job of politicians is to get elected.
3583
If they don't get elected, they don't have a job.
3584
While he's completely right (pun unintended), I don't like politicians that will do anything to get elected.
3585
Fuck that Moron and all of his conditions!
3586
Ron Paul is the real choice for the GOP.
3587
Rommel is a threat to Global politics and economics.
3588
His idea of enrichment for the rich will be the end of it all.then
3589
the new Global peace initiative will kill the rich, to save us all.
3590
i like the hell out of this idea!
3591
The problem with debates isn't that the human moderators need computers to help them fact-check, the problem is they're banned from fact-checking period.
3592
Presidential debates are organized and run by the CPD, which is a corporation 50% owned by the Republican party and 50% by the Democratic party.
3593
The rules are whatever is best for those parties.
3594
Before 1988, debates were run by the League of Women Voters, which is non-partisan, and ran non-partisan debates.
3595
So, for the '88 election Bush and Mondale Dukakis formed the CPD to be a common bloc against the LWV, to stop them from adding third-party candidates or making the debates too challenging.
3596
Eventually the LWV quit, because.
3597
It has become clear to us that the candidates' organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions.
3598
The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.
3599
So since 1988 debates have been campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions.
3600
Unless Watson is going to help them avoid substance more efficiently, this isn't going to happen.
3601
The real problem whit the debates is the fact that they aren't debates at all.
3602
The participants refuse to answer the questions asked.
3603
This is how it starts.
3604
We give them political influence.
3605
Romney: "Look, I'm an honest man."
3606
-Watson explodes-
3607
I like the idea but how would AI separate what is true from what is false?
3608
How would it determine, for example, whether or not there congressional Democrats wanted "death panels" in the 2009 health care bills?
3609
How would it decide whether Gov. Romney's claim that Pres.
3610
Obama "cut $716B from medicare" is accurate in its implications?
3611
It wouldn't take a supercomputer.
3612
It would take a Will McAvoy.
3613
There are a few problems with this That's not how Watson works No candidate would agree to a debate hosted by an artificial intelligence You can't even nail down the candidates official positions on half the issues, let alone fact check them.
3614
Although if they ever pulled it off it would pretty fucking hilarious to have a computer tell you that you're categorically, undeniably wrong.
3615
Watson does not fact check.
3616
It only checks what is popular or most written down.
3617
And it is mostly agnostic towards sources.
3618
A Watson fact-checker would view evolution as controversial.
3619
It would probably view anchor babies as a serious threat as well as ACORN.
3620
That is because most people that use these terms are crazy people.
3621
Fact checking political information is INCREDIBLY hard for even humans to do properly.
3622
It is more difficult for machines.
3623
If we do reach a point where Watson can fact check politics, we will have already developed full human AI.
3624
And we could have him run for presidency.

"I'm sorry Mr. Romney, Toronto is a US city, not Canadian"
3628
Con: That would be absolutely depressing to watch.
3629
Pro: more entertaining than reality TV.
3630
Someone's been watching The Newsroom.
3631
Yes clearly giant global megacorp IBM should be trusted with moderating politics
3632
Second that motion.
3633
All in favor say Aye.
3634
Fact checking has a liberal bias.thanks
3635
but no thanks-Sincerely the GOP
3636
WHAT IS TORONTO!
3637
Oh, I'll be that guy: Watson isn't capable of putting debate style questions and answers together.
3638
In fact, Watson didn't understand any of the questions it correctly answered on Jeopardy.
3639
It just found words and word combinations and ran through a database to determine the likely answer based on pre-determined information.
3640
(Okay, that's grossly simplified).
3641
In short: Having Watson moderate a debate would be like turning it over to the average Redditor.
3642
Allowing the general populace to hold onto their belief that at least one of the candidates is not a lying scoundrel prevents rioting.
3643
If you expose the fact that they are both jokes you'll disenfranchise too many citizens to the point where things could get ugly.
3644
There is no upside to the current powers that be for them to consent to this.
3645
Besides the fact that there is very little of substance being debated.
3646
Most of the issues of the day are wedge issues designed to polarize people.
3647
If sane reasonable human beings were to sit down and prioritize what is actually of vital importance to the survival of the nation, and it's prosperity, items like gay marriage, abortion, and gun control wouldn't even be on the agenda.
3648
I don't need Big Blue to tell me that both of the candidates, and for that matter both major parties are prevaricating power hungry pissants who certainly don't represent me, or have my interests at heart.
3649
To hell with Watson, I want Glados to moderate.
3650
Watson may not be feasible or accepted.
3651
but independent members of press could tweet in their fact checks on the fly.
3652
Summary of these opbjective opinions could be visually displayed on the screen as the candidate is talking.
3653
Green light for truthful comments, yellow for questionable, and red for pants on fire.
3654
The talking points are so pre-rehearsed at this point, the lights could be instantaneous.
3655
Speaking of talking points, aLso need an indicator of whether the answer actually deals with the question.
3656
I'd prefer Emma Watson.damn
3657
I hate showing up to a thread late
3658
It could have access to a massive library of videos or recordings of the candidates and interject anytime they contradict their own previously stated opinions.
3659
First debate where the candidates have to make up the questions on the spot.
3660
I'll watch the shit out of that.
3661
They wouldn't even try to use facts in their answers.
3662
They'd be vague and patriotic.
3663
Logic sub-routines have a known liberal bias.
3664
Sorry, its not natural.
3665
God did not intend debates to be run like this.
3666
I talked with Charles Townes, inventor of the maser and laser about this article, and he thinks its hogwash
3667
I'm not even going to read this article.

The state of pure consciousness during meditation is sometimes called "Self."
3674
The EEG pattern of this state trends towards a global, homogenous coherent alpha EEG covering wide areas of the brain.
3675
The more strongly this pattern shows up outside of meditation, the more likely the person is to report "Self" as a non-changing background state of non-judgemental watchful awareness, rather than as a set of disjoint beliefs, perceptions, goals, etc. IOW, perhaps the above finding isn't so surprising after all.
3676
Edit: A striking example of the kind of EEG associated with pure consciousness is found here.
3677
Note the global sine wave pattern that shows up briefly throughout the entire brain.
3678
This may merely be a measurement artifact or it might be a sign of the "fundamental frequency" of "Self'
3679
But why does it have to suck the MAN's will to live?

Higher field non-clinical MRI exists.

One of the problems with sodium sensitivity is the lack of specialized coils tuned and shaped for this type study coupled with the very low signal strength of Sodium.
3682
Cryo coils could be produced for this type study .resulting in multiple times the signal strength.
3683
The freezing point of water is ~273 degrees K. to hold these temperatures at 152 K over a larger and larger area as the size of the deposited CO2 increases would seem to be problematic.
3684
Remember, a 100 degree temperature differential encompasses 2 phase changes for water.
3685
The nominal temperature of Antarctica might seem to be a factor in supporting such a plan but in fact it is not really relevant.
3686
You might as well place such a plant in Germany or Paris.

Ive seen enough hentai to know where this oh wait?
3699
what?
3700
That was the most piss-poor account of what happened in "The Abyss" I've ever seen.
3701
That movie didn't have people breathing water.
3702
They (1 person) were breathing an oxygenated pink slime.
3703
Which is also cool, but completely unrelated to the story being reported on.
3704
I want more detail on the deformable particle so it's a lipid holding oxygen inside a container and the first containers were rigid and got stuck and they say an injection could last 20 minutes.
3705
Could you hook it up to an implanted pump (like an insulin pump) or just replace your lungs with storage space and have a fill-up port
3706
They've done studies, you know.
3707
60% of the time, it works every time.
3708
I knew pissing in my shampoo bottle would pay off
3709
isnt this a conspiracy theory!
3710
YES it does, at worst it makes you feel better about your self.
3711
If I feel bad about my self I take a run.
3712
During my run I get my energy out, and reflect on my current situation.
3713
It is personal time to think out what is happening and removes stress.
3714
After my run I always think more my highly of my physical self.
3715
If you and struggling, take a run.
3716
Even if your out of shape start small but just try it.and
3717
trust me, I know what I am talking about.
3718
There’s something intuitive about the idea that exercising makes you feel better about yourself.
3719
yup. really does.
3720
but keep in mind, depression is just unexpressed anger.
3721
nothing gets truly better 'til you express that anger.
3722
well it depends, are you sad because you are fat?
3723
then YES.
3724
Yo dawg, I heard you like parasitic fungi, so I put a parasitic fungus inside your parasitic fungus.

Seems to me that black holes are the only possible explanation as to what caused the latest edition of a big bang.
3726
If we aren't from the guts of a massive black hole then I do not see what else could have been the origin.
3727
Does it go .
3728
OM NOM NOM NOM!
3729
16 female subjects Yeah this is a totally reputable study.
3730
To be honest, this would be quite nice if this kind of a study was actually seriously considered.
3731
It would be great of analytic on why the things are correlated, if they are directly correlated, and what can be done as far as physical therapy is concerned to improve the sex life of a female.
3732
I don't see why sex should magically be ignored by science, and since orgasm is generally agreed to help with stress levels it feels like a natural event to consider improving.
3733
Well, it beat's Neil Strauss's 'C shaped or U shaped' smile line by a long shot.
3734
'hey, me and my friend were just discussing, and i told him i believe you are a woman that can achieve orgasm by vaginal stimulation?
3735
Am I right?' Slap
3736
The subjects were videotaped from a distance while walking, and were asked to complete a questionnaire.
3737
I hope they knew they were being taped before the questionnaire!
3738
I am sad it didn't have video examples.
3739
Must be nice to create your own work, by getting someone else to pay for something this meaningless.
3740
How many of you clicked on the picture of the girl to get a larger image?
3741
Thought so.
3742
non-clitoral orgasms were basically invented out of thin air by Freud and do not reflect any science on anatomy - basically, vaginal orgasms (where a woman is stimulated to orgasm from the vagina alone) do not exist.
3743
The start of this article is very strange: One good sign: In late July, a Senate committee, for the first, time passed the Safe Chemicals Act, landmark legislation sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, that would begin to regulate the safety of chemicals.
3744
Really?
3745
Chemicals have never been regulated before?
3746
The actual story here seems to be the paper published in the journal Endocrinology about the epigenetic effects of BPA at low concentrations.

"An automating tracking system so we can track the position of their eyes and reconstruct a virtual world.
3750
It will be a fully 3D virtual world to these organisms."

Amazing.
3752
If fish can have it, when can we?
3753
I wouldn't mind getting my hunting behavior analyzed.
3754
As long as it's inside an immersive virtual world.
3755
At first glance I thought this was crazy but the more I look into it and think about it I think it could work.
3756
It would need some of the world's billionaires (Brin, Gates etc) to chip in a couple of billion each to get the ball rolling and get governments on board but it could happen.
3757
Alright, I'll bite, but do we have to eat our own children?
3758
This is the state of global warming solutions?
3759
We are still in the dreaming stage of a plan to sequester 1/6th of the carbon we produce annually that requires the equivalent of half the wind power in China to be installed in the Antarctic in addition to other difficult-to-construct facilities.
3760
OH, and with no way to receive funding or be revenue positive except for government subsidies (which will happen when?).
3761
I half-hope this is a joke "modest proposal", but either way it's just depressing.
3762
This is THE most ridiculous thing I have ever read.
3763
This is the most impractical idea that is impossible to implement.
3764
Whoever came up with this idea has little to no understanding of Thermodynamics, economics, politics or common sense.
3765
I can not believe that someone thinks this is anything more than something proposed in futurama.
3766
Check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2taViFH6Y to see what this idea actually is.
3767
Next thing you know they'll actually propose the idea of moving the earth's orbit back a few feet (If you watch that futurama episode, that's what happened)
3768
The CO2 in the atmosphere came out of biomass.
3769
It needs to go back into biomass.
3770
Putting it somewhere besides biomass just creates the potential for a future, larger problem when it is re-released into the atmosphere (as it inevitably will be).
3771
Stop burning fossil fuels Stop burning down forests.
3772
It's not complicated.
3773
Ah more geoengineering solutions, how nice.
3774
Have you people heard of "climate gate" or ever considered that the Earth climate is influenced by so many other factors and you cannot just look at CO2 in isolation.
3775
Could someone provide a simple summary?
3776
Call me crazy but I can't help but wonder if you might get more bang for your wind power buck by installing that capacity in places without harsh alien climates, and using the electricity to prevent emissions in the first place.
3777
It's important to start thinking about geoengineering solutions now, but preventing x tons of carbon per year from being emitted is the same as removing x tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
3778
If you throw the laws of economics out the window to chase after wacky sci-fi shit like this you're actually making the situation worse.
3779
Also, enhanced weathering/biochar solutions are much more energy efficient ways to capture carbon from the air (although there's still a lot of development to be done on those fronts).
3780
Olivine is everywhere, and it loves to react with CO2 to form a stable, solid product.
3781
Energy wise it beats the pants off of the CO2 snow scheme, and it will actually keep the CO2 sequestered.
3782
I worry that the window we have to act on global warming is getting smaller and smaller, and I wonder if we are already past the tipping point will we have time to fix this.
3783
I've just read Red Mars and I think terraforming our own planet is a jolly good idea!
3784
I'm never ceased to be amazed by ants.
3785
Did you know they also return to their colonies by counting the number of steps they walk when they leave?
3786
And experiment was done where a group of ants away from their colony were captured by scientists who added pig hair stilts to their feet.
3787
Upon trying to return to the colony the ants overshot their target, walking past the colony by a distance that corresponded to the length of the stilts.
3788
They also repeated the experiment this time cutting the legs a bit shorter and noticed that the ants would stop to search for the ant hole too soon.
3789
TL,DR: Ants count their footsteps to return home.
3790
i had always wondered if it were possible to figure out the pheromone instructions to instruct ants to assemble buildings.
3791
I thought we knew this already - I've certainly heard that ants know how many foragers are needed based on how soon the other foragers return to the nest.
3792
Perhaps this is the first time it's been compared to the way the internet works?
3793
The discovery here is not the way the ants behave.
3794
Rather, it is the fact that we are now able to predict the behavior almost exactly using algorithms thus far believed to be our own invention.
3795
Quoting a reply from the user spooc: A protocol is an algorithm which, when applied, results in a certain behavior of information transfer.
3796
So if the behavior is the same, chances are they are using the same algorithm, showing that algorithms is a property of the universe to be discovered and not an artificial "invention".
3797
Actually that's also an argument against software patents.
3798
Fortunately for us, exoskeletons do not scale.
3799
Most biological structures do not scale well, for various reasons.
3800
You bet.
3801
We can start by having slime molds direct our transportation infrastructure.
3802
Only if you could actually kill them all.
3803
Those fuckers are small and I'm sure some got past you.
3804
OP, thanks for you post.
3805
An intersting article, however the title is misleading.
3806
The title implies that "the signals that ants send to each other are similar to TCP" - this would be sensational!
3807
However, in the article we learn that only the behavior of the colony resembles TCP, so nothing to do with signals.EDIT:Spelling, punctuation.
3808
I think you are confused.
3809
TCP is not a signal - it's a protocol.
3810
A protocolis an algorithm which, when applied, results in a certain behavior of information transfer.
3811
Yes, this is a terrible writeup and gets the details about TCP and congestion avoidance very wrong.
3812
There are actually several different algorithms, two common ones are named "Reno" and "Tahoe", there's also Van Jacobsen slow start.
3813
As a programmer who has done some low-level TCP work, it actually pains me to read this article, perhaps especially so because it's out of Stanford, where they really ought to be able to get it right.
3814
New slogan for this study better be "Anthill Inside"
3815
I'm pretty sure Henry Pym discovered this years ago.
3816
Don't know if it's already been said, but Terry Pratchett has this idea in his novels years before Stanford discovered this.
3817
The computer is called Hex. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex(Discworld)
3818
I saw a bit on ants on the animal planet and said that ants can communicate through the pheromones they deposit on the ground towards the direction they are traveling.
3819
This allows other ants to follow the line of pheromones left by the first ant.
3820
So the pheromones work as a means of addressing the destination, similar to IP, but obviously different enough not to draw a direct comparison.
3821
Perhaps we should call this combined protocol TCP/Pheromone?
3822
.that just sounds like a rudimentary feedback loop.
3823
How long ago would the ants have made the switch to IPv6?
3824
We need to study nature more closely, we might just learn something there.
3825
No because you can wander 20 minutes in a straight line or 20 minutes in a spiral and both will result in very different amounts of space covered, essentially rendering that information useless.
3826
Or, TCP algorithms are quite similar to the signals ants send each other.
3827
If ants bring back lots of food really fast, they send more ants.
3828
If they all die, they stop sending ants.
3829

The main problem would be the ant-riot that occurs, because the ants don't wanne be our slaves anymore.

Is it off-topic to bring up the possibility that Hex#Structureandtechnology) might not be as far-fetched as I imagined?
3847
Edit: can't get the link to work for some reason.
3848
Reminds me of Peter Stamets discover of the Fungi network that's basically an earlier version of the internet.
3849
So, to win the war against the ants, the humans will eventually figure out a way to DDoS attack their 'anternet'?
3850
Alright this is a ridiculously far out idea but humor me for a second.
3851
If we know how ants "algorithms" of communication work, would it be possible to build a device that could send pre-programmed signals to communicate things to ant colonies?
3852
I don't even
3853
Comparing the behavior to TCP algorithms is quite an unnecessary stretch.
3854
I guess the reason why this is on front page is because of internet reference.
3855
Seriously, does everything need to be alluded to the internet nowadays?
3856
Overrated.
3857
For some reason, I love the word "anternet".
3858
I wonder what their equivalent to cute kitten pictures is?
3859
Okay who let the little guy in suspenders come up with the name anternet.
3860
Does anyone know in what kind of material the ants in the picture built their hive?
3861
It looks like someone made them dig in some kind of gel, but as far as I know most ants are pretty picky about the place where they build their hive.
3862
Very cool!

I wonder if the anternet loves cats as much as the internet does?
3869
This article raises important parallells to our invention of TCP, but I think there's something more to be said on how we communicate within a certain system like the internet and how ants communicate.
3870
If we could conclude that TCP is analogous/similar to other forms of human-constructed protocols outside of the internet, then I think the article would draw a more important similarity between insect and human behavior.
3871
The title implies that ants communicate in a manner similar to how the internet works, but the article is about the fact that ants send out more foragers if foragers return with food quickly and fewer foragers if they don't return quickly.
3872
&#3232;&#3232;Don't be so deceptive.
3873
I'm hoping this will somehow make advances in the elimination of ants from my apartment.

The "farming community" has been fattening livestock with antibiotics for over a decade now.
3911
Do you really think constantly feeding them antibiotics was to keep them healthy BEFORE they got infections?
3912
Corn, lot's of grain, and anti-biotics.
3913
All they are missing is McDonald's french fries.
3914
The important thing to remember is that humans are a good portion of "symbiotic organism" and your stomach bacteria produce a lot of the neurotransmitters for your brain -- so destroying the flora and fauna of the gut can disrupt your natural impulses.
3915
A lot of food cravings are caused by bacteria that feed off sugars PUSHING you to obtain more sugar -- and when you don't they die off and you feel lousy.
3916
Even pheromones might be created by stomach bacteria -- so there is some evidence that a lot of our impulses are gut related.
3917
Not that we shouldn't EVER use antibiotics, but it should be stressed that people should restore intestinal bacteria and avoid processed foods while doing it -- otherwise, you might be ruining the "symbiotic organism" that is you.
3918
No, this wisdom is not from the bible and it kind of flies in the face with the common delusion that everything is about will power.
3919
I say it's caused by an over abundance of refined carbohydrates.

Antibiotics are the cause of superbugs, though I guess if they wipe out your gut flora then that would have some nasty effects body wide on you.

I feel like this might be an uncommon topic, but recently I've been reading about the theory of Chaos in science and the "Great Attractor" at around 1024.4 really struck me as congruent with the idea of attractors in fractal patterns.

This is especially curious because one thing Chaos seems to be boasting is universality- and what greater universality could Chaos have if it were on the scale of the universe?

The title is a little misleading.

They've directly detected the structure of a dark matter network through gravitational lensing.

Unfortunately, they still haven't directly detected any dark matter particles (such as the hypothetical WIMPs).

"Fluff" or not, it's nice to read a headline about U of M that isn't about football :)

Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up more than 80 percent of the universe Where did they get this number?

Perhaps they mean it makes up more than 80 percent of the matter in the universe.

(About 23/27 of the universe).
3945
I wonder if we'll ever get to a point where I can see a picture of what dark matter might look like.

Does that mean that theories like MOND and NGT are out the window?

2012 has been a great year for science!

Researchers from the University of California and University of Oxford in Geneva figured out a way to pluck sensitive information from a person’s head, such as PIN numbers and bank information.

I better not live long enough to see people "plugging in" to the internet.

It's a shame that we pour so many billions of dollars into intangibles when we still know so little about the environment we live in.

Hopefully this leads to more funding in the environmental sciences
