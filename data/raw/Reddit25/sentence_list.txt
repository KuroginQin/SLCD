i just cant wait to be crashing this plane i just cant wait to be crashing this plane
1
I still don't know why I sat through the first one.
2
Been waiting for this.
3
Even if it doesn't live up to the writer's expectations, I'm going to add it to my collection.
4
But then he wouldn't get to write himself into the movie of only to utter the word "nigger", as he's so fond of doing.
5
Primary Colors.
6
Cant explain it.
7
Just a good movie
8
Am I the only one who doesn't give a shit about Bond?
9
Look at it this way too, there was no new batman from 1968-1989.
10
21 years without anything new and when it came out it was super dark compared to the campfest that was the tv series.
11
Wayne's World
12
It was funny as shit!
13
ME! ME! ME! every freakin' time man!
14
Indian Jones and The Crystal Skull.
15
I've seen it several times, I still have no idea why it's so hated.
16
Worst - Shark Boy and Lava Girl although some might not consider Rodriguez a great director.
17
OP, I've never seen your answer to this question before but I totally agree with you that she is a great hero.
18
But my answer is Neve Campbell's character, Sidney Prescott, in the Scream franchise.
19
She isn't as hard or unbreakable as Ripley making her more human and relatable but she still has a lot of both emotional and physical strength being able to survive and outlast all the Ghostfaces she encounters for that 15 year stretch of her life.
20
There really is never a white knight or a deus ex machina and even the cops are essentially useless for most of the franchise.
21
She survives solely through wit and power.
22
Franka Potente in Run Lola Run.
23
She sure can run fast
24
Charlize Theron in Prometheus.
25
And Marion Cotillard in Inception.
26
"Get away from her, you bitch!"
27
No love for Trinity?
28
I agree with many of the ones I've seen here already, and would add Geena Davis from The Long Kiss Goodnight (a hugely under-rated movie).
29
Not my favourite but Catwoman from Dark Knight Rises was surprisingly really good and, in my opinion, the best Catwoman.
30
Sarah Connor from the first 2 Terminator movies.
31
She starts out as a care-free waitress and ends up a driven warrior.
32
My favorite bit is in the second film where she starts to look and an act more like a Terminator the more driven she got (as opposed to more blatant humanization of the terminator).
33
Then when she confronts Dyson she regains her humanity by realizing she can't take a life because of her emotional connection to the world she is trying to save and the people in it.
34
Top three:Beatrix Kiddo=Kill bill vol I and II Lisbeth=girl with the dragon tattoo Ripley=Alien
35
Ripley in Alien or The Bride
36
the icebox.
37
In The Godfather when Limpy got cancer.
38
Does "Tank Girl" count as quirky?
39
It's kind of an off-beat wasteland movie.
40
Tank Girl.
41
"I'm gonna hit you so hard your children will be born bruised."
42
More entertaining than Mad Max in my opinion.
43
insanely jealous.
44
Well done, sir!
45
Angelina Jolie's death scene in WANTED
46
The end of Big Fish.
47
a wish he would've been able to say "one day I saw a tangerine playing with a boy the size of a tangerine"
48
You learned to dance like that sarcastically?
49
.the star wars prequals.
50
Honestly, Jason Takes Manhattan isn't as bad as people like to say.
51
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
52
And excellent artwork, by the way.
53
too soon man too soon
54
Another david lynch film: Inland Empire.
55
I enjoy how absoluely bizzare it is, but im always afraid its too slow for some and too bizzare for others
56
Anything you have to pay attention to, most my friend like mindless movies so if there isn't giant robots punching things, they say its too slow or dumb.
57
(I like mindless movies too)
58
Harold and Maude.
59
Some people just can't get past the age gap, and as a result they miss a really enjoyable film.
60
Trying to explain it to friends is awkward.
61
Seriously?
62
Who hasnt seen the iron giant?
63
The Postman, the clan was awesome, and General Bethlehem was a badass.
64
Magnolia.
65
spoiler
66
I grew up in a house where movie-watching was a time to be silent and enjoy some cinema.
67
Apparently, when a girl invites you over to "watch a movie" on her bed, she doesn't really want to watch a movie.
68
She probably wants to touch your mouth and stuff.
69
But she owned Fight Club.
70
I really wanted to watch Fight Club.
71
I'd never seen it before, and heard great things about it.
72
So I ignored her sexual advances for the entire movie.
73
I was at the drive-in with my mother.
74
It was a double feature, and I can't remember what the first film was at all, but I definitely remember the second: Road Trip.
75
I was really excited to see it, because I was totally into Tom Green; thought he was the greatest.
76
The film opens up with this guy having a nightmare about his girlfriend and some other guy, and one of the lines is something like "I never came so many times in my life."
77
Immediately following that, I pretended to wake up from being asleep and mumbled, "Mom, can we go home, I'm really tired."
78
Knowing how the rest of the movie goes, I really dodged a bullet there.
79
hands down, Spiderman 3.
80
Saw Knocked Up with my mom when I was about 15.
81
Not as terrible as some of these other stories, still pretty awkward.
82
wasn't at a theater, but at home watching American Psycho for the first time with mom.
83
suddenly christian bale is fucking two whores and running down the hallway naked with a chainsaw.
84
looked at my mom and and stopped the movie.
85
Black Swan with my ex-girlfriend.
86
During all the sexual scenes, I could feel her staring at me with a "are you enjoying this?" chill going down my spine.
87
If I turned my head, I knew I was done for, so I just kept looking at the screen.
88
I love Monaghan.
89
I saw him recently on a few talk shows for The Day and he just seems like such a funny, chill guy.
90
He was great on Lost as well.
91
I saw it last night.
92
It was what I have come to expect from the series (brutal hand to hand, a good vehicle chase, an incomprehensible plot) and I love Jeremy Renner.
93
If they make a sequel with Renner I will see it no hesitation.
94
Slow-motion and 3D?
95
This movie may well be shit, but it is going to be beautiful.
96
I think he definitely has talent, but like you said he does so many crappy roles that people tend to forget this.
97
Besides the ones that you mentioned, I thought he was very good in Kick-Ass, as sort of a more comedic supporting role (which he CAN do, and well, when he has good material), but he was bloody fantastic in Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.
98
Such a twisted fucking film and he absolutely nailed it in my opinion.
99
I don't think Cage got lucky.
100
I think he's got a unique acting technique, and sometimes that attracts the wrong people in show business.
101
Sylvester Stallone.
102
I've never thought he was a good actor.
103
He got lucky with Rocky.
104
The only decent acting I think I've ever seen him in was the end of First Blood when he has the breakdown with Trautman in the police station about not being made for civilian life.
105
EDIT Rambo 4.meh.he
106
just spoke slower.
107
Talented.
108
Not every actor could pull off playing two entirely different characters in the same movie so well.
109
Watching him in Adaptation is nothing short of magic.
110
Not to mention the academy awards recognized him as best actor of the year for Leaving Las Vegas.
111
I'm not saying the academy is infallible, but they do tend to award the statues to actors deserving of them.
112
Nicolas Cage wouldn't be in even one movie had he not been related to Francis Ford Coppola.
113
I guess nepotism exists in every field of endeavor, but it's nerve grating to see actors who have no talent apart from having a powerful relative, getting given all the best opportunities, even after a series of flops.
114
Cage is not the worst in the world though - the absolute worst offender is Abhishek Bachchan.
115
My favorite poster is the one where he's holding a gun.
116
The Super Mario Bros movie.
117
I'm sorry, but Bob Hoskins was kind of perfect as Mario.the
118
rest of the movie depends on your willingness to accept the whole alternate dimension thing.
119
I don't really understand why people purchase movies.
120
Like on bluray or dvd etc.
121
Now ok I can understand that you would own your select few favorite movies, the ones you would watch several times a year or whatever, but I'm talking about people who purchase blurays of average thrillers and shit they'll probably watch once and that's it.
122
Just rent it.
123
til people have favorite screen kisses
124
Dead Alive
125
Underworld
126
I am going to have to go with the Michael Bay Transformers trilogy.
127
Terrible movies but I really like them for some reason.
128
But I can definetly fast forward through all the Shia antics.
129
I just like the action.
130
Sex Drive.
131
I know it's cheesy and caters to people 10-15 years younger than me, but I can't deny how hard I was laughing in the theater - as well as every time I re-watch it.
132
The only downside of the film is having to listen to Fallout Boy, but their screen time is limited and James Marsden & Seth Green are in their finest comedic form.
133
Sniper 1-3, the one that came out last year is complete garbage.
134
But I do like "the trilogy" very much.
135
Sky High.
136
Seriously way better than it had any right to be ;.;
137
The Raid: Redemption
138
Hailee Steinfield
139
Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz in The Fountain, around where the movie gets -fucking sad-.
140
People who've seen it will know the part.
141
Aronofsky has a way of showing raw humanness, especially in that kiss and a few scenes in RfaD
142
I found the dialog in Before Sunrise/Before Sunset to be pretty realistic.
143
Linklater seems to have a pretty good handle on realistic dialog.
144
That's cool that you found a message you can relate to in this movie, but it still sucked.
145
To say it's your favorite movie just because of one thing you found, that might not have even been the intention of Judge, I'd say maybe you relate to this movie in more ways than one.
146
Statham is this generations Van Damme.
147
and half his forehead .seriouslywatch
148
some of his recent movies and you noticeeven on the postersthey tend to hide his forehead.dude
149
your baldingand it's okay .but
150
f*cking Hollywood doesn't want to accept balding.
151
Let's glamorize shit and hide things that we can't.
152
This is the biggest reason why i am a huge fan of statham.
153
He is the badass in every movie!
154
i wonder if they have stock photos of him holding one and two guns in an aggressive manor.
155
But have you SEEN Crank 2!
156
He did something slightly different in movie London but then that was a shitty movie so whatever.
157
I'm pretty sure Crank doesn't count as it's clear self-parody of his archetype.
158
That said, shit pays the bills, he fits the part every time, gettin' paid gettin' paid.
159
It's not like you ever see one of these movies and think "Nah, this isn't a Jason Statham role".
160
He knows where he fits.
161
MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICHAEL CERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
162
yeah, actually i don't think jason statham would get sick of making tons of money for easy roles.
163
if i thought that i'd be an idiot.
164
True action star
165
I have never seen a Jason Statham movie.
166
Would anyone suggest the best ones I should watch?
167
Y'all people need to watch Revolver.
168
If his voice were any huskier, he'd sound like a broken air conditioner
169
Why would anyone get sick of being Jason Statham?
170
It's being Jason Statham, not sitting in a cubicle doing data entry for 8 hours a day.
171
Say what you want, the Crank series are just so fun to watch!
172
Either way i'll still watch all of his movies
173
Because of the sequels that's only five characters and the not the eight it's made out to be.
174
He was awesome in The Bank Job.
175
Highly recommend.
176
He was great in Revolver, and that movie was such a mind fuck, too!
177
5 of those movies are from 2 series.
178
That doesn't really count.
179
I don't think you can get tired of being a bamf.
180
I dunno .
181
that's like seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant.
182
It's funny but you never quite look at him the same afterwards.
183
I love that Statham (awesome surname) does these movies a lot like how Bruce Lee did his kung fu, you never saw him in a ballerina dress with udders, did you?
184
So yeah, stick to what you know and what you love.
185
To quote Lord Olivier when asked why he appeared in Clash of the Titians, he said for the money dear boy, for the money.
186
I do not know how much Mr Statham earns but I think it would be at least $5 million per picture.
187
A picture a year (or even every second year) is an excellent income.
188
When he gets writer's cramp from endorsing all those checks.
189
You don't watch a Statham movie for the acting.
190
You watch them for the cars, guns, action and bitches!
191
Hell naw, why stray from what you're good at?
192
Especially if it keeps you in buckets of money and Victoria's Secret Models?
193
http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jason-statham-net-worth/
194
I get paid a shitty wage doing the same thing day in day out.
195
Hey, you play the same guy everyday at work.
196
Do you get paid as much as Jason Statham?
197
You do realise that he is the same character in all three Transporter movies, right?
198
Same with Crank.
199
I love his face in the Transporter 2 poster.
200
Spacing out in the middle of a gun fight.
201
Well, I guess it's good if he enjoys what he does.
202
.but
203
looking at the Crank 2 poster, it's clearly a fake.
204
There's a DISNEY logo at the bottom corner.
205
You want him to be a different character in sequels?
206
I don't want this to be the new "thing" where people compile actors playing the same role.
207
Yes, it's called being typecast.
208
If you think about it, there are more actors who have this characteristic than those who don't.
209
Ewan McGregor is ONE person I can name who isn't typecast and really plays a variety of roles.
210
I can't name much more.
211
Honestly though I wouldn't mind a post that collages movie posters of some typecast actor, but this is extremely common
212
Steven Seagal isn't an actor, film crews just follpw him around and record different events in his life.
213
He does get to name them though Relevant
214
Steven seagal is not typecast.
215
He just is himself and the movies play around him
216
All those action movies and he still runs like a girl.
217
Isnt Seagal an actual cop? if not he had a show where said he was one
218
Doesn't everyone know this?
219
What's his best movie by the way?
220
And is it true, he rarely/almost never gets hit in his fights?
221
A friend and I worked at separate video rental stores, and had a challenge to discover a Seagal film in which he was not carrying a gun.
222
None of us ever won that challenge.
223
Nonsense- the guy has played almost every ethnicity.
224
The very definition of versatile!
225
I like the movie title "TODAY YOU DIE." Sounds inspiring
226
My roommate and I have EVERY Seagal movie there is and every one was bought for under $2 at a video rental store.
227
We used to get messed up and watch his movies while laughing our asses off at how ONE SIDED all his fights are in his favor.
228
He is always Ex CIA, FBI, karate master who gets away with whatever he wants.
229
His reality show only further proved his awesomeness though by showing off all his talents such as shooting accuracy, spotting crime, ect.
230
Seagal takes it to a whole new level?
231
You mean Statham never reached the level Seagal was at.
232
you forgot exit wounds
233
But in Flight Of Fury he wears a green jacket .
234
Steven Seagal played the mineshaft in Expendables 2. He was the only person with the acting ability to fit the entire cast inside him.
235
What the hell is "VOLT EGYSZER EGY IGAZSAG"!
236
LOL for anyone wondering what the korean one says, it says foreigner, which he would be considered lol
237
This pic is missing the 'Under Seige' 1 & 2 as well as 'Hard to Kill'.

Steven Segal Emotion Chart
240
Why am I the only one not bothered by this?
241
Stick to what you're good at.
242
I hate when "action stars" decide they want to do "real" movies.
243
They always suck and they end up doing lesser action movies after as a result of them tarnishing their name.
244
cough arnold cough
245
I want to be like Steven Seagal!
246
I'm sorry, I can't teach you how to be a bad Actor.
247
I've seen one of these movies, but there is no way in hell I'd be able to tell you which one.
248
I'd positively ID'd 3 of them before I realised.
249
Steven Seagal is Exit Wounds.
250
You forgot my favourite.
251
Half Past Dead.
252
Seagal isn't typecast.
253
He's literally incapable of any role other than the one.
254
i didnt know steven segal was a real cop till i saw an episode of his cop tv show
255
He shows a second facial expression while performing awesome music.
256
"He's a renegade , who doesn't play by the rules."
257
He is the undisputed king of B crime movies.
258
What's worse is that I don't get the impression that a single one of those films was even mediocre.
259
Famous martial artist in a movie.Better hold a gun in the poster.
260
We laugh, but then he most likely makes more than we do in a couple years, for just one film.
261
Typecast yes, but look at your job.
262
Are you typecasted doing that until you retire?
263
Shouldn't be that hard to go from a nurse to a truck driver, lawyer.
264
Shake it up.
265
And people think Nicholas Cage is the same.
266
his list of movies has quite the difference in plots.
267
Sadly, damn near every Seagal movie is the exact same.
268
At least Statham mixes it up a bit with the same type of action.
269
He's so fat and old now.
270
I don't understand how he's still cast in movies.
271
I want to watch one of his recent ones so I can watching him walk around panting and karate chopping people while sweating.
272
I must say his movies are top quality.
273
Top drawer entertainment.
274
My favourite of his has got to be Marked for Death, one of the greatest 'threat' lines ever: 'You bailed out a Jamaican street named Monkey the other day, I want him.
275
This other piece of shit, Screwface, I want him.
276
I know you're a scumbag and a puke, I don't mind that, but give me what I need and I'll leave here a nice guy.
277
If you don't, I'm gonna fuck you up.' (proceeds to execute conversational partner then another guy jumps out of a window), his next line is also quite something: Max: Well?
278
John Hatcher: One thought he was invincible.
279
the other thought he could fly.
280
Max: So? John Hatcher: They were both wrong.
281
Damn.
282
I love him.
283
Wasn't Segal cast in his first movie just because some guy said that he could take anyone that knew martial arts and make them an action star?
284
"He says things I can't say.
285
It involves a mannequin hand and an electric shaver taped to a golf club."
286
I think this guy is dead
287
I won't lie, I had never heard of him before he played The Joker.
288
But damn.
289
He was an artist.
290
I can never see him without wondering what other magnificent and impossible roles he could've perfected.
291
Looks like Joseph Gordon Levit
292
H.I.M. IMDb.
293
It doesn't say it was used for any movie or show.
294
:/
295
"Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?"
296
"That is an excellent question.
297
Yes and no.

oooof, kind of interesting, but Spoiler.

Dorkon all the way.

If you like nerdy interests, definitely check it out.
306
Documentaries I was more pleasantly surprised with though:* The King of Kong * Man On Wire * Roger & Me * The Fog of War * Spellbound
307
Missed the boat by a few months buddy.
308
Came expecting to be pissed off and to see reposts, was pleasantly surprised.
309
Haven't seen many of them.
310
Questions: Is there a higher res verison of 33? Cause holy shit is that one awesome.
311
And who is that in 35?
312
I enjoyed that, although it was 'Aliens', and not 'Alien'.
313
Also: the Gandalf stunt doubles?
314
Must try harder.
315
Love the one with Chewie and Leia.
316
Some old photos on the internet You've Probably Never Seen Before
317
There seems to be a typo.
318
I believe they meant 'Aliens', not 'Alien'.
319
There wasn't a queen in the first movie.
320
Arnold is repeating Hamlet and Cameron looks like he's afraid to interrupt.
321
Number 13 just ruined my childhood.
322
Love the one of Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and the kid Cap!
323
Is that Tobias in #41?
324
Both of the "Alien" pictures are actually from "Aliens".
325
I don't get why there are multiple Gandalfs.
326
Luke and Leia in Empire.
327
First time: good kiss, and better because it's done just to piss off Han. Second time: wait.
328
that's her broth.
329
AW HELL NAW!
330
Sunshine.
331
I think it has the right tone you're looking for, and also engineering porn.
332
I remember watching Return of the King and getting really excited to see the ending battle that takes place in the Shire only to be.
333
disappointed.
334
Bruce: 'I'm getting the fuck out of here!'
335
I'm glad this got cancelled.
336
but since we're kinda on the subject of TMNT movies, everyone should check out the first Eastman and Laird TMNT comic.
337
It might make you appreciate the first movie more.
338
Not a great movie but a lot better than the book: Bicentennial Man.
339
The novel was awful and hamfisted while the movie connected with people and showed proper motivations for the robot.
340
Oh god, not Vince Vaughn.
341
Oh Brother Where Art Thou
342
I heart huckabees.I do like David O Russel films, but don't usually like the more oddball stuff.
343
That said looking at the posters list would also include Fargo and Dogma.
344
Really don't get Wes Anderson though.
345
Gummo, that movie makes me giggle everytime I watch it.
346
What about fear and loathing in Las Vegas?
347
I have seen this idea floating around, and I love it.
348
It's like Lucas didn't really think that far ahead.
349
It would have made the whole trilogy feel a lot more cohesive, and Phantom Menace wouldn't feel like a prequel to the prequels.
350
I've also think you could replace Grievous with Maul.
351
If they wanted to keep the whole "bio suit keeping him alive" aspect, they could just have made Maul be horribly injured in his fight with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.
352
And then Obi-Wan tracks down and kills Maul, instead of Grievous.
353
Then that particular fight would actually have had emotional meaning instead of just a chance to show a dude using four sword---four swords!
354
they digitally shrank Chris evans's body.
355
it's all him.
356
do your fucking research.
357
Highlander, obviously.
358
session 9.
359
I'm glad I didn't remember much about the Damon movies, because I was able to sit through this one thinking of it as just another action thriller, and it was fine.
360
I hope they make a few more, so we can see how the Aaron Cross story develops.
361
It was a trilogy.
362
'Nuff said.
363
Try Satoshi Kon's movies - Paprika, Tokyo Godfathers, Perfect Blue, and Milennium Actress.
364
Actually if it's anything like what it's based on then the title is misleading and so in the trailer.
365
Do you actually seem either seducing each other?
366
Remember there is a man in there as well.
367
Best part was "Lady.
368
Give that man his purse back."
369
Still wouldn't have helped stop that train wreck
370
I see you've been to redlettermedia.
371
Maul got a raw deal in the prequel trilogy.
372
As did General Grievous.
373
There are so many things wrong with the Star Wars prequels that it's hard to know where to begin.
374
Practically all the information about what had come before that was given to us in the Original Trilogy ended up either thrown out the window entirely or used in such a cringe-inducing way that you wish they hadn't bothered at all.
375
Let's start with the Jedi - A New Hope is set approximately 20 years after the end of the Prequel Trilogy, and has a high up Imperial officer refer to the Force as a “sorcerer's ways?, and Han Solo calling Jediism a “hokey old religion.? The way they talk about it feels like something that has been almost dead for generations ?
376
an ancient ideology that practically nobody adhers to any more, aside from perhaps a handful of crazy old fools, much like Ben Kenobi is known for being at the start of A New Hope.
377
To go from an army of literally millions, based in a huge temple on the capital of the entire galaxy, who spend their days policing all the minor worlds in peace time and fighting as generals in war ? to go from that to an all but forgotten 'hokey religion' in the space of two decades is completely ludicrous.
378
If you're going to have the prequels even remotely make sense, the Jedi need to be downplayed majorly.
379
Perhaps they could have been that strong once, hundreds or thousands of years previously, but they need to be very much dying out by the time the prequels are set in order for the original trilogy to make any sense.
380
Ben mentions the 'Clone Wars', and Leia claims that he 'served her father' during them, 'years ago'.
381
That's a whole lot of interesting sounding backstory by itself, and provides a ready made excuse for having Obi-Wan fighting in a war during the prequels ?
382
if the Jedi are more like wandering heroes, pitching their lot in with whoever they decide needs their help, then having them decide to fight in the Clone Wars for Leia's father would make perfect sense.
383
Leia's father, by the way, would presumably have been a king of some sort, or else how the hell did she become a princess?
384
Not to mention the fact that Leia talks about remembering what her mother was like when she was very young, and a thousand other discrepancies.
385
Characters.
386
Have Obi-Wan as the protagonist right from the start.
387
Have him be just like Luke in A New Hope, young and headstrong and reckless, but kind of heart and a potential for wisdom.
388
Go overboard with the parallels if you like ? have a scene where Obi-Wan stands on a water planet watching two moons rising.
389
Whatever, go nuts.
390
Just having Obi-Wan as a central character for the prequels is the most important part.
391
Under absolutely no circumstances should Darth Vader, who was, prior to 1999, one of the most classically evil, completely terrifying villains ever to grace cinema, ever be shown as an annoying little bowl-cut wearing snot nosed idiot kid.
392
That's franchise killing stuff right there.
393
He also should absolutely not be shown to have previously unknown talents just thrown in, like, say, building complicated machines, like one of the homosexual robots from the original trilogy.
394
For example.
395
This would just be pushing it completely over the top.
396
Instead, Anakin should be introduced in the first film as already an adult, a space pilot, perhaps a smuggler, even.
397
Have him be handsome and suave, arrogant and cocksure.
398
Please note that these traits do not necessarily mean 'giant douchebag' - he would be sure of himself because he'd have heaps of natural ability, not whiny because people don't respect him enough, or whatever the Christensen version of Anakin's deal was.
399
Have him be the Han Solo to Obi-Wan's Luke.
400
Have the parallels be so obvious that people would leave the cinema saying “Wow, George Lucas sure is cheap, I can't believe he just used the same characters again, what a rip off.? Keep Qui-Gon Jinn, and still have him played by Liam Neeson ? the absolutely criminal underuse of Neeson was the worst thing about that damn movie ?
401
but for God's sake change the name to something less retarded than 'Qui-Gon'.
402
Give the character a slightly more interesting role ? the stoic monk type character that they were going for would have worked very well if they had actually done anything with it ?
403
contrasting that with the headstrong reckless nature of the young Kenobi would have worked well if anything had actually happened.
404
But here's the interesting part ?
405
Make Qui-Gon and Count Dooku the same character.
406
Don't have Qui-Gon immediately killed off at the end, as though this was supposed to replace any legitimate character development on Kenobi's part ?
407
get rid of that entirely.
408
Have the first movie end with Qui-Gon completely safe, and being all, “Okay kid, you did well, I'm done training you.
409
Have fun hanging out with that Anakin guy, he's very powerful so I'm sure he'll make a great Jedi.? He then steps back out of the picture, while completely safe and intact and still a good mentor to Obi-Wan.
410
Then a few years later, he comes back as a bad guy who attempts to persuade Obi-Wan that the Jedi are wrong and that Obi-Wan should join him instead, much like Dooku's role in Attack of the Clones.
411
Padme could stay pretty much the same character, albeit lacking any mention whatsoever of her being a thirteen year old Queen-Governor of an entire planet, or whatever that was about.
412
Have her be interested in politics and becoming a senator, that still makes sense ? in fact it makes a whole lot more sense if you take away her having previously been a queen.
413
Have her be the love interest for both Obi-Wan and Anakin, and give them an amicable rivalry over it, only for her to ultimately and inevitably choose Anakin over Obi-Wan.
414
Have Darth Maul and General Grevious be the same character.
415
This is so obvious that it's hard to believe they didn't put it in the prequels in the first place ?
416
they fill the exact same role in Menace and Sith.
417
Darth Maul gets dismembered, and Grevious is a cyborg, a droid with a living brain and vital organs.
418
Having one become the other makes perfect sense and would make for excellent foreshadowing for Anakin eventually becoming Vader.
419
Ultimately the biggest thing I'd change would be that, however ?
420
I'd never explicitly state that Anakin becomes Vader.
421
I'd have it heavily implied throughout, I'd have Obi-Wan leaving him for dead and Vader turning up being evil shortly afterwards, but it would only ever be hinted at that this is what has become of Anakin.
422
That way, Vader's reveal to Luke at the end of Empire would still retain its full impact ?
423
confirming what we all basically knew anyway, but infinitely more satisfying than three movies about how a whiny kid becomes a cyborg death machine who just wants to be loved.
424
also, the double-sided lightsaber should have been a huge reveal in the movie, not the last shot in EVERY FUCKING TRAILER.
425
Everyone knew it was coming.
426
Episode 3 have Anakin kill Maul in front of Palpatine instead, which irks Obi-Wan who wanted to kill Maul himself in revenge for Qui-Gon.
427
I feel that Obi's feelings towards Anakin killing Maul would be based solely on the manner in which is was done.
428
I don't think that Obi would be upset that he didn't get the chance to kill Maul himself.
429
Cool ideas.
430
I really liked Ray Park as Darth Maul and would have enjoyed seeing him more.
431
The thing about the Sith apprentices in the prequels is that Maul (groomed from a child), Dooku (turned Jedi) and Grevious (Cyborg) are all prototypes for Anakin taking over as an apprentice, so I think that all 3 bring something to the table.
432
I think Dooku was under used in Clones.
433
The biggest failing in the prequels, IMO, is the lack of a credible threat/proper bad guy in Clones.
434
They seemed to have to kill off Maul because of the "only 2, there are, no more, no less" line.
435
But Obi Wan taking Maul out seems to piss over the "i have the high ground" situation in Sith.
436
Not sure if Sith's are just pish whether having the high ground or not.
437
Should have kept Liam Neeson around for the entire trilogy to help train Anakin.
438
Good, now you just need a time machine to go back in time and give these ideas to Lucas.
439
Luckily, one will show up in Hill Valley, CA in three years.
440
Just wait in front of the McFly residence and steal it when its owner goes inside.
441
Make sure you come back in time to just after you left, and don't leave bits of your cane in the car.
442
Now, while we wait for that to happen, let's talk about the Matrix sequels.
443
It's hard for me to talk about the prequels without launching into a diatribe about how the tone of them should have been darker and adult; that making a "kids" film with Phantom and then progressively becoming mildly darker was a very poor choice.
444
But regarding Maul, I like the idea of him escaping Ep 1.
445
But here's where I'd differ.
446
I'd keep Dooku, but as a secondary Sith Lord or perhaps just a former Jedi being manipulated by Sidious unwittingly.
447
In fact, he need not even be a jedi.
448
He could just be a politician.
449
Lucas completely diluted the ending of Ep2 and Dooku's death in Ep3 packed no real dramatic punch.
450
So, I'd have Anakin kill Maul at the end of Ep 2 while Dooku escapes with the plans for the Death Star.
451
I'd have him do it in front of Obi Wan, after losing his hand.
452
Anakin loses control and in a frightening display of anger turned to power, he destroys Maul.
453
Obi Wan is worried, but when Yoda arrives, Obi Wan lies and says he was the one who killed Maul, not Anakin to save Anakin scrutiny from the council.
454
Yoda is suspicious, but lets it go.
455
Then in Ep3, Anakin kills a defenseless Dooku while Obi Wan is unconscious and lies to Obi Wan about him being dead while they're escaping Grevious' ship.
456
Anakin's descent into the dark side needed to have started sooner and needed more punch than just killing some sand people and Dooku.
457
This is stolen from belated media you swine.
458
Episode I: Obi Wan and Qui Gon run into Anakin, just by chance.
459
Anakin is 19 years old and they can sense that the Force is strong with him.
460
Qui Gon gets permission to train him to be a Jedi, begins that training, but Anakin is quick to anger, so Qui Gon suggests that Anakin takes a break from the training until his mind can be at peace.
461
Meanwhile, Darth Maul is causing mischief throughout the galaxy and no Jedi has yet been able to stop him, much less meet him in battle.
462
Anakin continues his training, but Qui Gon and Obi Wan are called away as Darth Maul has been found closeby at the planet of Naboo.
463
Anakin is instructed to stay and practice what he has learned, though he wants to help his new friends fight this Darth Maul.
464
He's sure that he can help them, but they are equally sure that he isn't ready yet.
465
Anakin watches them leave the planet, then gets into his own ship, determined to give them assistance, whether they want it or not.
466
Obi Wan and Qui Gon quickly find Darth Maul as he has been setting detonators to destroy the planet, bombs that will knock Naboo out of its orbit and into the nearby sun.
467
As the bombs start going off and the planet is becoming unstable, Anakin sets his ship down near a palace.
468
The inhabitants insist that he takes their Queen (Queen?
469
She looks to be his own age, how can she be a queen?) with him on his ship to safety.
470
Anakin tries to explain that he's not there to rescue anyone, he came to fight, but there is no time to argue.
471
There is no time!
472
The inhabitants force both of them back on Anakin's ship and as he takes off, he sees that the inhabitants are floating with him, all gravity has been lost on the dying planet.
473
And all hell is breaking loose where Obi Wan and Qui Gon are finally doing battle with Darth Maul.
474
He's proving to be too much, even for Qui Gon, and now they have to fight through all of the weightlessness.
475
Qui Gon makes one fatal miscalculation against Darth Maul and he pays the final price.
476
Obi Wan looks on as his mentor is stabbed through his heart and he becomes enraged, determined to kill this red bastard to make him pay.and
477
then he hears a voice.the
478
voice of a friend.Qui Gon pleads to him, Obi Wan.no.not with anger.you
479
must flee the planet.NOW Obi Wan collects his thoughts and the anger melts away, he collects the floating body of his good friend and makes his way to their ship.
480
Darth Maul allows him to retract from the fight, as he had been instructed to do by his master, Count Dooku.
481
Obi Wan encounters Anakin's ship just as he is leaving the exploding planet, surprised to see that he is here at Naboo, when he is supposed to be practicing his training.
482
Obi Wan waits until they return to Coruscant to inform Anakin that Qui Gon is dead.
483
Anakin could sense something through the Force, but he did not know what it meant.
484
Now, he knows what death feels like through the Force and it is a feeling that he will not forget.
485
Anakin's mourning turns to anger as he realizes that Obi Wan let Darth Maul get away.
486
We could have stopped him.
487
If you would have told me and trusted me, we could have stopped him together.
488
But, Obi Wan reminds Anakin that he was much closer to Qui Gon than anyone, and if he thought that it would have been prudent to do so, we would have.
489
Anakin accepts this explanation, though he doesn't agree with Obi Wan's decision.
490
In fact, it borders on cowardice to Anakin, though he will not mention that to Obi Wan.
491
They go to meet with the Jedi Council to discuss this threat that Darth Maul is presenting and they find out that a favorite politician of the Jedi has been elected to a position of leadership in the Coruscant Senate on promises of purging the galaxy of this terrorist known as 'Darth Maul'.
492
He makes public claims that the Jedi will assist him in this task, for it is their duty to help those in need.
493
Episode II: Anakin and Padme are secretly married, as the Jedi can have no attachments which may bring danger to them or to those that they love.
494
But, Anakin doesn't agree with this antiquated notion, besides he's strong with the Force now, so he would actually welcome some danger because since he as become a Jedi, there hasn't been much action.
495
The citizens dare not to tangle with the Jedi and there just doesn't seem like there's much to do lately.
496
There's certainly no excitement on the 'Darth Maul front', the Jedi are still unable to track his whereabouts and it doesn't seem likely that they ever will.
497
How strong can the Force be, if you can't find one puny guy?
498
Padme can sense his boredom and frustration and she suggests that he spends more time with Obi Wan, but Anakin says that Obi Wan doesn't trust him and he can sense that he is always holding something back when he is in training with him.
499
And if Obi Wan doesn't want to trust him, that's fine with me, I don't trust him either and certainly not enough to be his friend.
500
We're both Jedi and that's all that we will have in common.
501
But, soon after sharing his feelings with his secret wife (Padme isn't a Senator here, in fact, she is living on Coruscant in secrecy), Anakin is called to meet with the Jedi Council.
502
Darth Maul has shown his ugly red face again and the Council wants Anakin and Obi Wan to investigate it.
503
They must go to Kamino to meet with Qui Gon's old master, Count Dooku, as he claims to know what Darth Maul has planned next.
504
Anakin and Obi Wan find their way to Kamino, meet with Count Dooku, who informs them that the Grand Army of the Republic is coming along nicely, that they will soon be ready for battle.
505
Anakin and Obi Wan exchange confused looks and ask whom are they to battle?
506
But, Count Dooku just waves them off and tells them to just let the Jedi Council know.
507
Count Dooku tells them that Darth Maul is being directed by none other than Leader Palpatine and that his reign of violence will not stop because it is the very thing that keeps Palpatine in power.
508
It is the truth, but Anakin and Obi Wan can only see it as a lie.
509
They are strong in the ways of the Force, and the Jedi Council would have sensed that something this grand was being directed right under their noses if it had a shred of truth.
510
But, it couldn't be true, this Count Dooku has clearly lost his mind in his old age.
511
Obi Wan and Anakin return to Coruscant with absolutely no new information about Darth Maul, less the ravings of a mad man.
512
Anakin tells Obi Wan that he will meet up with him later at the Council, but he needs to stop by his home first.
513
Obi Wan knows exactly what Anakin means, even if Anakin thinks that he has hidden his feelings well.
514
Obi Wan knows that Padme is staying with Anakin, but he doesn't know about their marriage.
515
Obi Wan will keep this secret from the Jedi Council as a favor to his friend.
516
Anakin arrives home to find it ransacked, destroyed really, and Padme is no where to be found.
517
Crime on Coruscant?
518
At the home of a Jedi?
519
This is impossible for Anakin to imagine and it only leads to one conclusion: this must be the work of Darth Maul.
520
And now, he has Padme.
521
Anakin rushes to the Jedi Temple to instruct the others that his wife is missing.
522
And then that thought stops him.
523
His wife.
524
The wife that doesn't exist, cannot exist, if he is to remain a Jedi.
525
He realizes that he cannot tell anyone about this, and he suddenly becomes hopeless in a way that he hasn't felt in a long time.
526
He decides that he must trust Obi Wan, he's his only hope.
527
Anakin goes to Obi Wan in private, and right away, Obi Wan can sense the pain and turmoil that his friend is feeling.
528
Before Anakin can even say the words, Obi Wan stops him, I know about her.
529
Where is she now, Anakin?
530
Anakin breaks down and Obi Wan sees his good friend weep for the first time, but he can also sense the anger and frustration welling up inside his friend.
531
Obi Wan tries to comfort his friend and remind him that he can only use the Force find her if his mind is pure from anger and hatred.
532
Those emotions will do you no good and only cloud your mind, my friend.
533
They both devise a plan to go to a distant planet and they shall both try to find her using the Force because they cannot easily do so under the watch of the Jedi Council.
534
When they arrive on Geonosis, Anakin can immediately feel Darth Maul's presence.
535
How did we randomly know that he would be here?
536
Obi Wan tries to tell Anakin to be careful, but Anakin is already in full stride, sure that he is going to find Padme now.
537
Anakin cannot sense her presence here, but he won't allow himself to think about the possibility of what that could mean.
538
Anakin senses something just before he turns a corner, so he immediately stops in his tracks and peers around the wall.
539
And there he is: Darth Maul.
540
The time to act is now!
541
Anakin rushes forward towards Darth Maul, determined to make him pay for what he has done to millions of beings, including his friend Qui Gon.
542
But, Darth Maul fights with a quickness and a viciousness that Anakin has never encountered before and he is quickly overwhelmed.
543
His right hand pays the price for his stubbornness to listen to Obi Wan's advice and he is helpless to fight Darth Maul now.
544
But, Darth Maul retreats to his ship as he was instructed to do so by his master, Count Dooku, who specifically ordered him not to kill the boy.
545
Obi Wan misses a chance to fight Darth Maul, yet again.
546
Continued.
547
Episode III: Obi Wan and Anakin are still unable to locate Padme, and they decide that they must inform the Council to get their help.
548
It may cost them their positions in the Jedi Order, but they are getting nowhere on their own.
549
The Jedi Council agrees to assist them and in a few days, they have a glimpse of hope that Padme has been found.
550
It may be nothing, but someone has seen a woman in chains on the planet of Rosha.
551
The Jedi Council wants to send anyone other than Anakin and Obi Wan to investigate this lead, but Yoda insists that they can win back the trust of the Council if they can complete this task without falling victim to their emotions, and they have earned this chance with their prior loyalty and service.
552
As Obi Wan and Anakin enter the Leemurtoo system, they can sense something different in the Force, a darkness that was deep and foreboding.
553
Anakin could also sense something else, it was Padme, he was sure of it.
554
They raced to Rosha, and quickly after they got off their ship, Anakin could see that someone was strung up on a wall far away, it almost looked like they were crucified.
555
Oh no.it's her! Anakin raced forward, not sensing the danger that was just ahead.
556
Obi Wan saw him take off running and tried to catch him, to call out to him about being careful, but it was too late.
557
Obi Wan watched helplessly as his friend dropped through a hole that opened up under him and swallowed him up.
558
Obi Wan stopped in his tracks and quickly straddled the side of a wall.
559
He peered around the corner to see Darth Maul drop down through a hatch, presumably to do battle with, or worse, his good friend.
560
Obi Wan had to fight the urge to run to help Anakin, but he was damn sure that he would find a way to help his friend, this time.
561
Obi Wan assessed the layout of the situation before him and made his move.
562
But, he didn't see (or realize, strangely enough) that Count Dooku was watching him from a rooftop above him and Dooku sent a long bolt of force lightning through Obi Wan.
563
It debilitated him immediately.
564
While Count Dooku held him in this state, Anakin was in the fight of his life with Darth Maul.
565
Anakin was enraged, fully and completely, determined that Darth Maul would not win this time.
566
And with his rage, anger, and fury, Anakin found that he became stronger with the Force.
567
Much stronger than he had ever felt before, he never imagined that his blows could be this powerful.
568
Darth Maul was no match for this new Anakin, and he quickly made sure that he proved that point.
569
Padme was watching her husband through the grating on the floor, but she didn't recognize his face now.
570
As he battled with Darth Maul, his eyes were glowing red, she was sure of it.
571
He was becoming a monster right before her eyes.
572
Where was the kind man that she once loved?
573
Surely, it couldn't be this grunting and screaming maniac who was chopping this creature apart.
574
She could hear him scream as he sliced.this
575
is for taking my hand.and
576
I'll take your legs, and your arms, and your head!
577
She wanted to cry out to him to stop this, but the chain around her neck silenced her cries in her throat.
578
Or was it fear?
579
Yes, she was afraid of her husband.
580
Or whatever that thing is down there, because it's certainly not Anakin Skywalker.
581
Anakin used the Force to break the escape hatch open and he flew out of the trap that was set by Count Dooku.
582
Oh, yes, dear Count Dooku, and there he is now, toying with Ben Kenobi.
583
How quant.
584
I believe I'll kill him now.
585
Padme watched as Anakin literally flew through the air to plant himself in front of Count Dooku.
586
Anakin used the Force to send Ben Kenobi's force stunned body through the air, slamming into a nearby wall.
587
Count Dooku was impressed and pleased to see how strong Anakin had become with the Dark Side of the Force, but Anakin was going to wipe that smile off his smug face.
588
Oh yes, killing life forms makes you stronger, Anakin was sure of it now, and Count Dooku would be the next life form that Anakin would feed off of.
589
Obi Wan regained consciousness and his first instinct was to help Anakin in his battle with Count Dooku, but that was no longer Anakin, Obi Wan could see and sense that.and
590
Padme.she's in danger!
591
Obi Wan sensed that Padme was about to lose consciousness and he rushed to free her from her captivity.
592
Obi Wan carried her to the ship, placed her in the seat behind his and got into his own pilot seat.
593
She let out a quiet.anakin.before
594
she passed out.
595
As Obi Wan left the planet surface, he saw that Anakin had two light-sabers now as he chopped off Count Dooku's head.
596
Obi Wan made arrangements to rendezvous with Bail Organa, so he could leave Padme with him, while he tried to lure Anakin away from Padme.
597
Obi Wan didn't want to know where they were headed, as he was sure that this new and more powerful Anakin would be able to find out from him, whether he wanted him to or not.
598
Obi Wan headed to Mustafar and he hoped that Anakin would find him there.
599
Obi Wan had just disembarked from his ship when Count Dooku's ship, well, it was Anakin's ship now, arrived.
600
WHERE IS SHE? SHE'S NOT WITH YOU! WHERE IS SHE, KENOBI?
601
Obi Wan could see what the anger and hatred has done to Anakin's face.
602
She's not here.
603
I KNOW THAT! DON'T WASTE MY TIME, KENOBI, WHERE IS MY WIFE?
604
Anakin stared with glowing red eyes into the gentle blue eyes of his former friend.
605
ORGANA.
606
that's all that Anakin could pick out.
607
Obi Wan pleaded with Anakin to stop what he was doing, not to go down the path of the Dark Side, but it was too late.
608
Anakin was much stronger through the Force now, and there was no way that he was going to give this new power up so easily.
609
Anakin gave Ben Kenobi a chance to get out of this alive.tell
610
me what or where this ORGANA is and I'll let you live.
611
Obi Wan refuses and the fight is on.
612
Anakin fights with anger, which lead to mistakes, but Obi Wan is unable to really capitalize on any of them.he
613
didn't want to kill his former friend unless he really had to.
614
There is good in him, I can sense it.
615
But, Anakin is now a changed man, no longer merely a Jedi, and certainly something stronger and better than just a Jedi.
616
Anakin not only wants to kill Ben Kenobi, he now feels that he needs to, he must.
617
He has to feed off his life force to become even more powerful.
618
The power seems to be limitless!
619
Eventually, Obi Wan is trapped on a small island on the lava planet and Anakin gives him one last chance to save himself: just tell me about ORGANA.
620
Obi Wan refuses and Anakin makes his move.
621
As Anakin is flipping through mid-air, Obi Wan maneuvers himself to the side at the last second and quickly slices Anakin's legs and an arm from his torso.
622
Obi Wan mourns over the loss of his friend, his Padawan, and for the wife that loves him, but he hears a ship approaching and he senses a danger and a darkness that tells him that he must leave immediately.
623
Newly installed Emperor Palpatine instructs his medical droids to retrieve Anakin's body.
624
What have they done to you, my son?
625
We will get our revenge in due time, my boy.
626
Rest now, you've had a busy day.
627
A few scenes of Obi Wan informing the Jedi of the terrible mistake that they've made by allowing Palpatine to seize power, the Jedi scatter across the galaxy, Palpatine executes Order 66.
628
The Imperial Army is created and the Jedi are declared enemies of the Empire.
629
Padme lives near the Organa family while she gives birth to her twins.
630
Obi Wan and Yoda decide that it would be too dangerous for Padme and her children to live together, surely Anakin or the Emperor would find them if they weren't in hiding.
631
So, Obi Wan agrees to take Luke with him to Tatooine , to find a nice family that will raise him, and he will watch over him the best that he can.
632
Padme dies later of natural causes and the Organas adopt Leia as their own child.
633
And now, the Emperor can set the trap that will use the design plans of the Death Star as bait to lure Obi Wan out of hiding, so Darth Vader can face him and destroy the hope of the Resistance once and for all.
634
*Now, in this version, I skipped over the Clone Wars, because let's face it, they were boring as fuck in Episode II, it was a skirmish at best.
635
Hardly a war.
636
I would include a little scene where the Jedi are fighting some clones in some war that has really nothing to do with the plot of the prequels, if I had to.
637
TL;DR: You must unlearn what you have learned.
638
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgICnbC2-Y
639
The prequels need a unifying arc and theme.
640
By theme is ambition and empire, and the arc is obi won's journey from youth and ambition to age and wisdom.
641
it opens with Qui-gon and kenobi on their way to naboo, an important, if provincial, world.
642
Quigon is a unimportant, but respected master with a reputation for scholarship, kenobi is an ambitious, but so far undistinguished knight.
643
Naboo has been complaining of being raided by unknown ships, and have requested aid from the republic.
644
Upon landing, several things are made clear.
645
First, the Jedi are not respected.
646
They are seen as obsolete religious figures, little more than charlatans.
647
The naboo wanted defense ships, not monks.
648
Second, jedi powers are MUCH weaker than we have seem previously, and this seems perfectly normal to the jedi, though quigon insists this wasn't always the case.
649
Also, while on the planet, they encounter anakin, a palace servant who quigon notes is unusually strong in the force.
650
While they are on the planet, a massive fleet drops out of hyperspace and commence invasion.
651
The Jedi at first assist, but realize it is hopeless and decide to return to warn the republic of the threat.
652
They take anakin, but their retreat is halted by darth maul, who demonstrates the sort of force powers we are more familiar with.
653
Sensing that he is more than a match for them, quigon sacrifices himself so anakin and obi can escape.
654
They flee to coruscant.
655
There we find a gleaming imperial capital, utterly corrupt and decadent.
656
Obiwan reports to the Jedi council, which is not led by yoda.
657
Yoda is the senior and most respected jedi, but he is not the formal leader, that position is held by someone more political.
658
The jedi are extremely skeptical of Mauls powers, but sense political opportunity in the threat in general.
659
The council decides to go to the senate.
660
The council leader manages to inflame the senate, talking about the glory of the republic, the might of its arms, its dignity, etc, etc. Led by a .
661
the fleet of the republic is assembled, much more slowly than it should have been.
662
Big ships, big guns, but they have clearly seen better days.
663
The ships are old and ill maintained, the captains political hacks, the admirals doddering and overconfident.
664
despite the council's maneuvering, the jedi are not given a formal role, but quigon finagles a spot on one of the ships.
665
The fleet is sent off in grand fashion.
666
When it arrives in naboo, things go poorly.
667
The overconfident admirals engage and quigons ship is hit. he hits an escape pod.
668
He crashes near the capital, battle raging all around.
669
he makes his way to the palace, and is confronted by darth maul.
670
He defeats him by tapping into his emotions and thus, unknowingly, the dark side.
671
With maul dead, the invading fleet retreats, despite clear superiority over the republic's fleet.
672
Everyone returns to a hero's welcome, all the failings ignored.
673
The crisis is declared officially over, with promotions all around.
674
Kenobi is made a Master, touted as a hero of the republic.
675
He requests anakin as his pupil and, over Yoda's objections, the council gives him to him.
676
Movie two is about the early clone wars.
677
The unknown enemy thought defeated returns, and are revealed to be a clone army.
678
The republic completely fails to rise to the task, only to be reinvigorated by an alliance between palpatine and the political jedi.
679
It is also about obiwan training anakin, poorly, unknowingly teaching anakin to tap into the dark side the way he did.
680
Over the course of the movie, Obi won begins to be disgusted with politics, and to shift away from his initial support of palpatine, and becomes a friend and ally of yoda.
681
Movie three is the end of the war, and the split between obiwan and anakin over their ambition and the latter's support of palatine.
682
Palpatine detects what O and A had been doing, and pushes them.
683
But while the much more experienced obiwan can control himself, and anakin can't.
684
Obiwan does not like what he sees, and tries to reign him in, admitting what he has done to yoda, which makes yoda realize the sith are back, but it is too little too late.
685
Palpatine pushes him over the edge and uses him when he betrays the jedi.
686
All in all, lots of changes.
687
We don't see the war much from the people the republic is fighting.
688
Padme is an exceedingly minor character, a step above someone anakin knocked up, really a symbol of his corruption more than anything else.
689
The jedi are not universally benevolent figures.
690
Count Dooku exists only as the politically minded head of the Jedi Council.
691
much more focus on the wider war as opposed to half hour long lightsaber fights, and jedi power made a heck of a lot more subtle.
692
or he could have just been given much more screen time in Ep.1
693
I disagree.
694
It would be better if Obi-Wan beat Maul, had the opportunity to kill for revenge, but decided against it (because good characters don't take revenge).
695
Then Anakin kills him, and it creates a rift between the two.
696
There were many issues with it, and in 20 years, maybe we'll see new Star Wars media that lives up to our hopes and dreams of what it should have been.
697
These Two will make your tear out hair in clumps over what it wasn't and what it could have been.
698
I would pay all my money to see it redid like this first kid pitches.
699
Belated Media Rewrites the Prequels.
700
Red Letter's Outstanding Review.
701
im good with that just so mace windu can live
702
Completely agree.
703
Dooku was just so boring and old.
704
It's like the Episode IV battle but without emotional implication which makes it just boring.
705
Maul was the perfect bad guy and could have at least made Episode II watchable.
706
I actually preferred Episode One over the next two.
707
Yes, everything was shit in it - but the other two reminded me of shit that someone smeared in a bathroom stall.
708
Or George Lucas just shot everything out of his asshole and said "Here is the script guys!
709
Smells good doesn't it!"
710
As far as your thoughts - I think the characters in Episode One were as stale as you could get.
711
By the end - I really didn't care who did what.
712
Just wanted the movie to end.
713
I completely agree.
714
Darth Maul was cool.
715
When I was a kid and Phantom Menace came out I was all about Darth Maul.
716
They should have made him a bigger villain than he was.
717
Make him last two movies at least.
718
I also agree with getting rid of Count Dooku, giving his role to Darth Maul.
719
One of the many problems with the prequels was trying to jam too much shit into them.
720
Keep it simple.
721
The original Star Wars trilogy was fairly straight-forward.
722
You can keep up with it.
723
In the prequels it's like you have to take notes to remember who all the characters are and what sub-plots they're involved in.
724
There's no doubt the prequels could have been done better.
725
I've heard enough good fan suggestions to know Lucas didn't even try.
726
Another good suggestion I've heard is to basically scrap the Phantom Menace, along with Darth Maul, Jar Jar Binks and Qui-Gon, and start the trilogy with Obi-Wan and Anakin, master and apprentice, doing Jedi shit.
727
More time to flesh out their relationship, more time to flesh out Anakin's relationship with Padme, and more time to flesh out his transition to the dark side.
728
I believed before the 3rd movie that maul survived and became General grievous.
729
Made the movie better while watching it.
730
I've been saying this for years.
731
I agree completely.
732
Nothing against Christopher Lee but Dooku was such a boring villain.
733
Darth Maul would have been so much more exciting.
734
I agree about maul, he was a cool ass sith, why kill him off that fast?And after all that hype about him
735
Saw the movie opening night.
736
When Maul bit it my buddy turned to a kid in full Maul makeup and said "Bet you feel stupid now."
737
Best part of the night.
738
According to the commentary on the DVD by Aronofsky, the self-improvement TV show/character was a creation of his and not in the book.
739
He said Sarah watched soap operas and other general stuff in the book, but he didn't want to date the movie so he used a character he created for an old project in film school.
740
This means that there may not be an answer to your question, but you could always look into reading the screenplay or book if you really want to know.
741
Not in the same vein but Dead Mans Shoes is one of the best British films you will ever see.
742
Revolver, another Guy Ritchie film, but over processed like crazy.
743
The entire film looks like a photoshop
744
You don't have to pay all that much attention to be genuinely disturbed by that one.
745
Batman and Robin "WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS!
746
THE ICE AGE!"Great stuff Also, the Happening.
747
Didn't that land an NC-17 rating?
748
I saw the trailer for it (didn't look like anything spectacular) but I saw that it was NC-17 which was interesting to me cuz you don't see NC-17 films with big stars like Mathew very often
749
The Diving Bell and the Butterfly was such a beautiful adaptation.
750
I also thought that the Coen brothers did an excellent job adapting No Country, and then of course One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
751
There's a lot of realistic portrayals of fraternity life in Animal House.
752
All of the parties and craziness.
753
1408 - Awesome movie.
754
I agree.
755
It depends on what you like but Drag Me to Hell was good, its more of a quirky horror.
756
Insidious creeped the heck out of me.
757
Devil was one of Shyamalan's better movies.
758
We also found a baby mouse inside a used condom this was changed in the unrated version to We also found a deer vagina on the back seat.
759
We thought it was human lips- but no, it was a deer vagina.
760
Wow.
761
I didn't even know this existed.
762
"Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!"
763
The Bad Seed is probably my favorite but I'll also put Let the Right One In (Let Me In - American version), John Carpenter's Village of the Damned, and The Ring (though cheesy not, that movie scared the crap out of me when it came out) on the list.
764
The Hole.
765
I mean the movie was decent but the book by Guy Burt was AMAZING and it's all of like 164 pages.
766
I also liked The Uninvited and Mr. Brooks.
767
Trilogy of Terror II?
768
There was a kid named Bobby who died off a cliff at the beginning but came back.
769
Oh and it was a series of short stories
770
ask /r/tipofmytongue
771
Never Let Me Go had near perfect young versions of all three of its stars.
772
River Phoenix as a young Harrison Ford in Indy 3 was very good.
773
I never finished the film, but Alexander had a near perfect young Colin Farrell.
774
It's not really the main characters, but there's a scene in Braveheart where a new bride is taken away by an English Lord to have the First Night, she gives her new husband a kiss before going with the Lord.
775
The whole scene is perfect, the kiss is subtle and understated enough to keep the emotion of the scene together.
776
Krull
777
Kracker Jack'd
778
Two way tie between The Room and Showgirls.
779
fantasy.conan the barbarian (or destroyer to a lesser extent, still good despite things), labyrinth, legend, the dark crystal (yay 80's fantasy all of the thigns mentioned so far) also krull if you like cheese, and willow sci fi: the first alien movie, the first star trek movie (only ones i liked from either series of movies, though i know many disagree wholeheartedly) and tron legacy gilliam flicks: time bandits, brazil, the brothers grimm, the adventures of baron munchausen (couple of these are fantasy, a couple sci fi)
780
im gonna let You Guys finish but Stepbrothers had the best Ferrell quote "I'm gonna put my nutsack on your drumset"
781
It's a beautiful yet disturbing film and takes you on a roller coaster ride.
782
When I finished it, I had trouble thinking for a few hours.
783
It exhausted me but let me captivated.
784
The effects, the editing, the uneasiness, and the story all played perfectly off of each other to deliver one hell of a film that provokes the mind and leaves you horrified and satisfied the same.
785
One of the best films I have come to watch within the past year.
786
It's a good example of a movie that's so bad it's good.
787
It's bad because it's imagination exceeds its budgetary wherewithal, and the whole movie is building towards a joke.
788
"You can't piss on southern hospitality!
789
I won't allow it!"
790
Great line!Besides this and The Room, I would suggest Mac And Me.
791
I sat down and watched it with my little sister, she was upset with how bad it was.
792
It's my favorite movie of all time.
793
It is really bad, but the problem is that it isn't worse.
794
If it were Chernobyl Diaries, at least you could make fun of it.
795
You couldn't believe how lame it is until you see it.
796
Orphan, The Omen
797
Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard
798
i'm sorry, but NO 'JAWS'!
799
that's one of the greatest movies ever made, and it made a much better film that book.
800
wtf!
801
Glengarry Glen Ross is full of such smooth, engaging dialogue that the actors just feel so convincing as their characters
802
The color palette in this movie was just awesome and so true to the comics.
803
I think Speed Racer is the only other movie to do this well.
804
Making a live-action adaptation of a comic or cartoon, but keeping that same style from the source material is hard work and it looks awesome.
805
I remember it too there was a guy on a train rushing to the wedding
806
Is it It's a Date? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032644/
807
edited to add link
808
Any of these?
809
Children of Men might tickle your fancy.
810
The Noah - not quite sci-fi, but an interesting take on the "last man on earth" idea, done in a style reminiscent of The Man From Earth.
811
Another Earth!
812
Sci Fi film with minimal special effects.
813
More of a drama-Sci-Fi flick though.
814
Se7en! Way ahead of its time, and Trent Reznor headed the sound track.
815
Can't beat a movie with Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey in it.
816
Too bad Saw stole a lot from this film and turned it into a gaudy, gore-porn monstrosity.
817
The Hangover.
818
This movie is getting a tremendous reponse from everyone who has seen it.Although premature,it's got a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as well.Can't wait to see this movie.I'm not really into Judge Dredd,but this movie will hopefully make me a fan.
819
It looks okay but it'll probably end up being a sleeper hit like district 9 or Scott pilgrim.
820
Feels like they could only think of five pages for the script so they figured, 4000 frames, thats how we will stretch it into a feature!
821
"Year 3000 : Battlefield Earth - Aliens enslave Earth,and other tales from Scientology.Let's hope Futurama happens."
822
Good News Everyone !
823
Thetan-repellent guns invented !
824
'Hackers' is on TV right now,and she looks so gorgeous in it.
825
Is this the first time you've come across a "Mockbuster" ?
826
These movies have become fairly common,and this is from Asylum,a studio that's best known for this schlock.
827
Dud I thought that scene in hong kong was CG.
828
Mind blown.
829
I also liked the idea of the gauntlets having a flash when they ejected.
830
Christ Michael Bay is awful.
831
You forgot about the fact that it's hilarious.
832
It is fairly entertaining, I didn't find it creepy at all though.
833
One of those movies where the ending really lifts up the entire film, just from its WTFness.
834
Hell, I even enjoy the second and third one as bad movies that are kinda fun.
835
Was it just me or was most of the acting ridiculously bad?
836
The ending somewhat made up for it though.
837
If you're into horror films, definitely worth a watch.
838
Certainly one of my favorite chessy 80s horror films.
839
It had such a different setup than so many other films of its time.
840
Most horror films like the Freddy or Jason or Michael Myers, you go into it knowing the motivation of the killer.
841
But I love in sleepaway camp they save that reveal until the VERY last scene.
842
They hint at it with the flashback scenes here and there, but that final scene wraps the whole thing up beautifully, I love watching it with ppl who have never seen it before.
843
SPOILERS: i've always felt with a more disturbing (read: sexually disturbing) rewrite of the script and a bit more production value, a remake could be incredibly powerful.
844
i feel like it could focus more on the creepy aunt who treats a boy like a girl for his whole life and how that sexually frustrates him.
845
This, in combination with the fact that the boy had two gay fathers, one of which was killed in a terrible boating accident, could make for a very progressive and unnerving murder mystery.
846
I loved this one.
847
Also, it, and the rest of the series, was basically Scream before Scream came out.
848
Oh, and of course, the little hanging surprise at the end.
849
Also, if you want to a see standout, but not wholly original slasher flick that takes some of the tropes and settings, and sets em on their head, check out intruder from 87, not to be confused with the intruder from 62, another very good movie worth checking out.
850
Oh wow.
851
That's an old rumour.
852
The other two I believe were Ben Stiller and Jack Black.
853
The idea was, these were too be the next generation trained by Egon, Pete, Ray, and Winston.
854
No word on who was to be, if any, Winstons token black guy stand in/replacement.
855
I'm not holding my breath for a ghostbusters 3.
856
If it does come to be, I'd be hard pressed to be excited for it, unless they find a way to really blow me away.
857
But they are older, so it would be hard to see it work.
858
I say, if they can re-cast, Batman, Superman, Captain America, Hulk, the x amount of tv show based movies, and fuckin Star Trek of all things, and make it work, why not do the same for ghostbusters?
859
Yeah, I figure it's one of three things.
860
He's Aspergian/Autistic, no offense to anyone who really is, I'm not trying to be mean or stereotypical, but it could be the case.
861
He is just crazy Or just, distant and weird.
862
Where is this available?
863
Is this like on overseas versions of the movie only?
864
IE Not USA.
865
The Big Lebowski
866
Who Can Kill A Child? Excellent Spanish horror movie, same sort of idea as Children Of The Corn, but much better.
867
Silent Night, Deadly Night, although, he's not quite a kid.
868
The Brood.
869
Oh yeah.
870
Gimme Shelter, a guy gets stabbed, for real, on camera, during the famously infamous rolling stones altamont concert.
871
And I believe some of the stuntmen died during some of the shooting of the first mad max, although I'm not sure what scenes.
872
Zodiac, Jacobs Ladder, Chinatown, The Third Man, Blue Velvet, Blood Simple, A History Of Violence, Dead Ringers, Cape Fear, Scorsese Remake, The Night Of The Hunter, Straw Dogs.
873
I'm a big fan of this, because it means that frame rate can be an artistic decision instead of a monetary one.
874
As it should be.
875
Why the hell should they charge more for more FPS?
876
Not like it's in 3d or some other crap like that.
877
None of these movies deserve a remake.
878
I can't believe Zardoz is on that list and They Live isn't.
879
Worse than The Devil Inside?
880
And I think Malfoys father was already disappointed after he played the gorrilla-hating guy who runs a gorilla sanctuary who leads to the eventual taking over of earth by gorillas.
881
To kill a mockingbird.
882
Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch
883
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest The Shawshank Redemption
884
Adaption (ADAPTATION) was awesome
885
I really liked The Road.
886
The atmosphere and the acting is just superb and very well adapted from the novel to the big screen.
887
Surprised to see Godfather was nowhere in the list :( It's one of the few movies that turned out BETTER than the book!
888
I liked Harry Potter :(
889
I think No Country For Old Men deserves a spot at the top of that list.
890
No Blade Runner ?
891
Forrest Gump.
892
V For Vendetta!
893
Jurassic Park?
894
"By the book!
895
The 5 best movies from the last 15 years based on novels"
896
Needs more Kubrick.
897
The Shining
898
Jurassic Park.
899
Ellroy was afraid that moviemakers would ‘screw it up beyond redemption.? I bet that's the greatest fear of every author.
900
Really tough to choose just 5, but I think all of these would be challenginv for my top ten.
901
Anyone else excited for the movie adaptation of On the Road by Jack Kerouac?
902
Um, The Godfather?
903
Quit a glaring omission there.
904
well I know that the authors of both Fight Club and The Prestige liked the movie counterparts more than their own work so i'll nominate those two.
905
The Prestige deserves to be on the list
906
There Will be Blood was based on a book i think.
907
i think it was a better movie based on a book from the past 15 years then L.A. Confidential
908
Atonement.
909
It was a great movie and Saoirse Ronan was amazing as Briony
910
My favourite adaption is Lolita!
911
Sellers/ Kubrick was such an awesome combo.
912
Shame they only made two films together.
913
Holes.
914
Trainspotting.
915
The book ) is a bit of a bitch to get through at points, though.
916
I pretty much had to read it aloud to myself to understand what exactly was being said.
917
Example, the first two sentences from the novel: "The sweat wis lashing oafay Sick Boy; he wis trembling.
918
Ah wis jist sitting thair, focusing oan the telly, tryin no tae notice the cunt."
919
forest gump?
920
No Country for Old Men is surprisingly accurate with the book.
921
I'm not finished yet but some of the conversations are even 1:1 with it.
922
The Coen Brothers did a great job staying true to the book, something I can't say Peter Jackson did well.
923
This list was designed to provoke rage.
924
By having such a small selection from such a huge range of potential choices, you're going to annoy a lot of people.
925
I mean, these are fine movies but I'm very surprised to not see such quality films as Jaws, The Godfather, The Shining and The DaVinci Code in there.
926
How come there isn’t one movie on this list made before the 90’s?
927
How is "A Clockwork Orange" not mentioned?
928
The orchid thief.
929
JAWS - the book is garbage; the movie is what every film should ever strive to be, perfect.
930
Fontane Effi Briest by Rainer Werner Fassbinder
931
Dune
932
Schindler List?
933
The lord of the Rings?
934
It seems the author didn't read the books.
935
I would say "Invictus" and "Like Water For Chocolate".
936
But the last case is almost cheating, since the director is married to the author of the book.
937
I feel somewhat torn by the inclusion of LOTRs, it was a fine achievement to turn it into a filmable movie.
938
But for me, I found it DID NOT capture or surpass the book, and in fact found the film to be very undramatic.
939
It did not succeed at creating an epic world for me.
940
There was too much editing and relying on the music to keep the pacing and the actor's lines and dialogue I found to be very stilted as if they were saying the lines blindfolded: Very wooden.
941
Secondly the inclusion of female characters to balance the book's male focus felt perhaps necessary but far too contrived.
942
It felt like a long B-rate fantasy because the drama of the characters never surpassed the tourism advert of New Zealand imo, which admittedly was breathtaking.
943
I agree with Fightclub.
944
The film is better imo.
945
And The Shawshank Redemption would be the best example I can think of.
946
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
947
wow, she looked like an alien her whole life :/No offense
948
Mystery Men
949
What if I told you could we cut spending without cutting services such as food safety and border security?

I love nicotine but am not addicted to cigs and can easily go months without one.
954
Do people who aren't addicted ever buy e-cigs?
955
Yes, in the book it was more or less stated that he had Asperger's
956
He's not my favourite director, but it's about time Tarantino turned his hand to sci-fi, I'd watch the shit out of that.
957
If this is real, someone should forbid Bay from ever making movies that have ties to comic books EVER again
958
Anyone have a side by side with a current photo.
959
I would make one but I am on my phone
960
Well just on the subject of space racing, The Right Stuff details the lives of the pre-Apollo US Astronauts and Tom Hanks made a TV miniseries called From the Earth to the Moon, which is kind of companion series to Apollo 13, showing different aspects of all of the Apollo missions in each episode.
961
There should be a bunch of engineering porn in both.
962
lol the rocketeer
963
If you like Watchmen, I'd recommend V for Vendetta.
964
However, I think 50.50 would be a good movie for anyone to watch.
965
Ok, maybe not everyone but most people.
966
Black Dynamite.
967
Everybody needs to see Black Dynamite.
968
Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring.

It used to be Michael Fassbender, glad to see he's respected now.
973
I wouldn't say up-and-coming but I think Emile Hirsch has more to offer.
974
Not a one liner but - Terry - “If we were in the wild, I would attack you.
975
Even if you weren’t in my food chain, I would go out of my way to attack you!
976
If I were a lion and you were a tuna, I’d swim out in the middle of the ocean and freakin EAT YOU!
977
And then I’d bang your tuna girlfriend.? Allen - “Ok, first off, a lion?
978
Swimming in the ocean?
979
Lions don’t like water!
980
If you placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that makes sense.
981
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20 foot waves (I’m assuming it’s off the coast of South Africa).
982
Going up against a full grown 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?
983
You lose that battle.
984
You lose that battle 9 times out of 10.
985
Well guess what?
986
You’ve wandered into a school of tuna and we now have a taste of lion!
987
We’ve talked to ourselves.
988
We’ve communicated.
989
And I said, ‘You know what!
990
Lion tastes good!
991
Lets go get some more lion!? We’ve developed a system: to establish a beachhead and to aggressively hunt you and your family.
992
And we will corner you and your, your pride, your children.? Terry - “How you gonna do that?? Allen - “We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp!
993
We will be able to track certain amounts of oxygen.
994
It’s not gonna be days at a time.
995
An hour?
996
Hour 45?
997
No problem!
998
That’ll give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.
999
You just lost in your own game.
1000
You’re outdone and outmanned……?.Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go? ?NOPE.?
1001
Hope you like prison food.and

1011
Michael Bay to do the TMNT movie.
1012
Edit: Just fucking with you guys.
1013
All you need now is Ben stiller and you got a shitty movie right there
1014
No that is a horrible cast.
1015
The Black Cauldron is pretty dark, though it's not so good.
1016
Great Mouse Detective also.
1017
Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is rather dark, but has lots of light as well.
1018
I think Snow White is pretty dark also.
1019
The Black Hole.
1020
Hunchback of notre dame, prince of egypt and the iron giant(I found the iron giant a bit dark but it's still very light hearted)
1021
Secret of NIMH is pretty dark.
1022
From posters it looks like a cute talking animals movie, but there's more to it.
1023
The original The Rescuers.
1024
An American Tale has some pretty dark sequences.
1025
I presume The Brave Little Toaster was already mentioned.
1026
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Paprika, The Castle Of Cagliostro, Ghost In The Shell, 5 Centimeters Per Second, and pretty much anything by Studio Ghibli
1027
Sweet.
1028
I love both Considine and Mullans works.
1029
I really liked Mullan in Session 9.
1030
Mullan is a great actor.
1031
Absolutely incredible film.
1032
I love Paddy.
1033
Dead Man's Shoes was so damn sad.
1034
I'm not saying Apatow is my favorite director but I'd really like to see him and his usual crew get the rights to make Ghostbusters their own.
1035
Funniest behind the scenes I've seen in a while.
1036
Something almost Python-esque about it.
1037
3000 - Futurama: Aliens live on Earth, shenanigans.
1038
Probably the most accurate description of the show
1039
2032 - Ghost in the Shell 2 "Sex robots turn on their owners."
1040
Yay for products working as advertised?
1041
Logan's Run is when people turn 30 - (it's the book that's 21)
1042
The Dune one is wrong.
1043
It is 10191 based on the Dune calendar but it actually takes place in something like 20000 AD
1044
Year 5 billion: Earth is destroyed as sun goes supernova, the species gather and watch "safely" from a space platform.

They need to hurry up with these Jaws sequels

According to this timeline, things went bad pretty quick for the Jetsons.
1047
Looks like someone just hand delivered my playlist for the next few weeks :D
1048
I hate pot noodles.Vindaloo and lager is more like it
1049
It makes me sad to think that I won't be around to see this future unfold.
1050
It'd be so cool to sit back and watch it all happen.
1051
like a movie
1052
It was 30 for Logan's Run, wasn't it?
1053
Also, Lister hates Pot Noodles.
1054
Curry was his muse.
1055
Rimmer: "Just a pot noodle, oh and I found a tin of dog food on the tool shelf."
1056
Lister: "Well, it's obvious what gets eaten last, isn't it?
1057
I can't stand pot noodles".
1058
(upon trying a Pot Noodle in a "perfect" version of Red Dwarf): Lister: I've been to a parallel universe, I've seen time running backwards, I've played pool with planets, and I've given birth to twins, but I never thought in my entire life I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle.
1059
I need to think of a good Sealab 2021 quote!

1066
They missed the most important thing about 2015 from Back to the Future.

The Cubs win the World Series.
1068
"I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy who says shenanigans!" Edit: Gah beaten to it.
1069
I love you for putting Cowboy Bebop up there.That is all.
1070
What about Iron Sky in 2018?
1071
Space Nazis invade and then Spoiler
1072
sounds like the future holds a lot of shenanigans for us
1073
This is a repost that needs to be updated.
1074
Need to add "Prometheus" to complete the "Alien" timeline
1075
Upvote anything mentioning Red Dwarf.
1076
Still one of the best shows ever made for TV.
1077
I really like The Fountain description "People float around outerspace in bubbles, meditating next to big trees."
1078
Whoever made this obviously has never watched Red Dwarf, Lister eats curries and would rather eat dog food over a Pot Noodle.
1079
Upvote for Titan A.E.
1080
Such a good movie.
1081
Hey so it's only three years until I get my hoverboard?
1082
Right Marty?
1083
Right?
1084
In the Doom movie they aren't really demons from another galaxy.
1085
They are normal people that have had an extra gene implanted into them which mutates them into killing monsters.
1086
But.Dave Lister hates pot noodles, he loves curry.
1087
And an up-vote for Red Dwarf.
1088
I AM LEGEND IS A VAMPIRE MOVIE
1089
TIL some movies are set way further into the future than I thought.
1090
Bicentennial Man- No.
1091
In the film, robots are not recognized as human.
1092
Only one is, thus only legitimizing his specific union to a human.
1093
In that film, he's the only robot to have gained sentience for some unknown reason, through a fluke.
1094
It's highly unrealistic, since no work was done to figure out how he became sentient, which is absolutely what would have happened, regardless of who owns him.
1095
Additionally, by the time we have so many robots, we'll absolutely be on our way to strong AI.
1096
Regarding I Am Legend, this post said they were zombies when they are actually labeled as vampires.
1097
So RoboCop basically hit the nail on the head regarding Detroit.
1098
You forgot Pandorum
1099
Dave Lister from Red Dwarf hates Pot Noodles, he eats curry all the time.
1100
Great timeline though :)
1101
I'm a little disappointed that Neon Genesis Evangelion was left out.
1102
That's a rather epic apocalypse.
1103
I am very disappointed the Warhammer 40,000 universe isn't included.
1104
I think Equilibrium seems like a fairly accurate prediction in all honesty.
1105
Red dwarf he does not eat pot noodles.
1106
except once "I tell you one thing: I've been to a parallel universe, I've seen time running backwards, I've played pool with planets, and I've given birth to twins, but I never thought in my entire life I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle" .
1107
Beginning of the Universe: Arceus is born.
1108
Isn't V for Vendetta alternative history and not the future?
1109
Fuck yeah Red Dwarf!
1110
Definitely one of my favorite shows.
1111
:]
1112
Dave Lister 3
1113
Humans and aliens living together in New New(New New New New New New New New New New New New New) York in 5,000,000,053 AD.
1114
I understand that this is based on movies, but I think someone should remake it including televisions shows as well.
1115
There's a lot of "history" in Doctor Who.
1116
Space Odyssey (How the fuck does this not make the list?)
1117
I fucking love red dwarf.
1118
Total Recall: Mars is colonized, air is a commodity, some women have three tits.
1119
Shenanigans.
1120
FTFY
1121
Happy to see Cowboy Bebop, GITS, & AKIRA on the list:3
1122
2022- Soylent Green
1123
Planet of the Apes had the clock saying 3978, not 3955.
1124
Beneath, the sequel, fucked up and said 3955.
1125
On The Time Machine, they forgot that the Morlocks ate the Eloi.
1126
I swear to god I'm gonna pistol-whip the next guy that says 'Shenanigans'!
1127
Why isn't Starship Troopers on here?
1128
That is an important moment in human future history
1129
Red dwarf is wrong.
1130
He doesn't wake up, in fact he gets frozen in time because of shenanigans, then his cat causes the ship to spew radiation which kills everyone.
1131
Gotta love that curried.everything.
1132
Tis a sad day.
1133
While not being a avid reddit user I have now seen my first repost.
1134
:( You guys said it would come but I didn't want to believe you.
1135
Oh the reposts
1136
I thought shenanigans was code for explosions until the entries for The Jetsons and Futurama.
1137
but Lister HATES pot noodles
1138
I didn't see Silent Running.
1139
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listoffilmssetinthefuture
1140
I certainly do enjoy the fact that this timeline ends with Red Dwarf.
1141
Smeg.
1142
Ghost in the Shell 2 is not a different movie than the first one, just reproduced.

1144
Lister is a awful guitar player
1145
Nooooo where's gattaca?
1146
Wait when did they make a Terminator prequel called Terminator 1/2! .
1147
Ohhhhh
1148
This is fun, the only problem I have is that the Matrix series isn't 2199.
1149
I know that Morpheus tells us it's 2199 but the Architect tells us that Neo is the 7th incarnation of "The One".
1150
Since Neo can only pick a handful of humans to restart Zion there is no way that it is only 2199.
1151
It would take many hundreds of years to go from 20ish humans to over 200k.-endrant
1152
I am Legend: they weren't zombies; they were vampires.
1153
The year 400,000,000,000.
1154
Ren and Stimpy experience Space Madness.
1155
I've hoped for YEARS that The Running Man would actually happen.
1156
Only with extreme criminals, though.
1157
Leave it up to them, but if they wanna compete in deadly games, I'd love to watch.
1158
A lot better than letting them rot in prison doing nothing.
1159
Might as well make some money from it.
1160
And hell of a lot better than any reality TV show that has ever existed.
1161
More entertaining than UFC.
1162
I'm not seeing a downside here.
1163
what the fuck is "de-evolved"?evolution
1164
only goes one way, you cant un-evolve, de-evolve, or anything such as it.
1165
1977 - The Omega Man.
1166
Almost all Earth's population wiped out in biological war.
1167
1983 - Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.
1168
Cats and dogs all die in plague.
1169
2058 - Neuromancer.
1170
2100 or 2200 or 2300 etc. - Silent Running.
1171
Most plants on Earth dead.
1172
2400 - Buck Rogers (b.
1173
1898) reanimated, saves Wilma Deering from the Bloods, aligned with the Han Chinese in airships.
1174
No sign of the Crips.
1175
In the Matrix Reloaded the Architect tells Neo that the "cycle" (the creation and destruction of Zion) has happened six times.
1176
Assuming the Matrix exists for ~200 years every time, then it's more like the year 3399 than 2199.
1177
Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Wilkes Booth
1178
OP, can you clarify if you're looking for a movie that contains a footage where REAL people died or just footage of people who later died?
1179
They made a movie for a guy who's going to win the election.
1180
Awesome job Republican film makers!
1181
Awesome Job!
1182
A fool and his money are soon parted.
1183
They say Obama's going to take their guns.
1184
Gun sales skyrocket.
1185
They enrich fundamentalist evangelical preachers.
1186
The CFA debacle had lines out the door.
1187
And now this.
1188
All it proves is that republicans will give away their money to millionaires the first chance they get, provided it makes them feel good about their bigotry and hatred.
1189
The thing that got me is how flawless the lip sync is.
1190
Its twice as funny because it looks legit.
1191
I think he's a psychopath.
1192
I just thought it was the classic "acting by not acting at all" technique.
1193
He is a psychopath; that's the whole point of the movie.
1194
Ryan Gosling's character is actually the bad/scary guy in this movie which makes it so amazing.
1195
The character has no emotions and is trying to fit in with this family to see if he can make being normal work.
1196
Think about it, at the end of the movie what is stopping him from taking all the money and going living happily ever after with the girl he just killed for?
1197
Nothing.
1198
Yet he just ups and leaves because he feels nothing and doesn't really care.
1199
The only good guy in this movie was the husband trying to get a fresh start for his family, but in real life good guys die.
1200
Ryan Gosling's character is actually pretty terrifying in a very subtle way.
1201
He goes from kissing a girl to stomping a guy's face in with the same dead-eyed look on his face.
1202
Loved the movie.
1203
He might quite possibly be a psycho.
1204
I think that's the whole point of his character, the whole mystery of where he came from or what he used to do that got him here is what intrigues the audience.
1205
The modern Man With No Name.
1206
A friend of mine thought he was supposed to be autistic.
1207
He doesn't say much because he's a loner.
1208
But he totally is a psycopath.
1209
Read the book its so so so much better.
1210
Someone I know compared the driver to the man with no name from that old clint eastwood western ?
1211
I assumed he had aspergers, or was at least lacking in emotional affect.
1212
No shit, OP.
1213
I mean, what's next?
1214
"Hey, I don't think Daniel Day-Lewis' character in There Will Be Blood was a very nice person.
1215
Was this intentional, or am I missing something?"
1216
I have a fan-theory that he was actually in a coma living out his fantasies as the driver.
1217
In the movies you see people socializing and having meaningful conversations with roommates, boyfriends and girlfriends.
1218
In reality you will spend most of your time crying alone in the shower and will only speak to others when they speak to you first.
1219
In case you can't tell I'm a typical friendzoned redditor lol hahahha :)
1220
I forgot that art direction is the single most important feature of a film.
1221
Your analysis of how their is a distinct color palette is nothing short of genius, I had never realized that before.
1222
Have an upvote for your incredible commentary you rascal.

Joesph Gordon Levitt as Andrew Johnson.

Daniel Day Lewis as Ron Paul, Lincoln's son.

Samuel L. Jackson as Christopher Nolan, Lincoln and Ron Paul's descendant (for the epilogue) Kevin Spacey as King George the Third, Lincoln's sworn enemy
1232
Revenge of the Nerds.
1233
No one goes around tormenting nerds in college.
1234
In fact, it's possible to avoid fraternities and sororities your entire college career.
1235
That was very well made, but I have one gripe: since this was part of a trilogy and the audience wouldn't know who Yoda was, they would have been very confused to hear this strange voice in a conversation with Luke.
1236
Plus, it would have spoiled the introduction of Yoda because you knew that he was real (certainly what he sounded like, so the surprise factor is gone when Yoda reveals himself to Luke) and he would provide answers for Luke.
1237
I would have used dialogue with Obi Wan over that teaser trailer instead.
1238
if it's anything like Tomorrow when the War Began i want nothing to do with it.
1239
Interesting.
1240
I've always assumed American universities are a lot different than what I've experienced based on movies.
1241
Looks like they don't even depict American universities accurately.
1242
Question for Americans: fraternities and sororities - big deal over there?
1243
Seems like it based on movies.
1244
That's the thing that seems the most different from my university experience.
1245
Dark City and The thirteenth floor.
1246
Could have been great
1247
Exposing the snobby girl naked isn't a hilarious prank.
1248
It's sexual assault.
1249
There is no social pecking order like in high school.
1250
You won't spend all your time being tormented by "jocks".
1251
(Almost every college movie ever.)
1252
You won't get an A in all your classes if your roomie kills himself.

1254
Ok, that was pretty good.
1255
"A tangerine the size of a tangerine" bit got me.
1256
A new one of these needs to be made for TDKR, with his use of 'Chimpanzee'.
1257
Bruce can't decide whether or not he's interested in that batsuit.
1258
This is a glimpse into madness.
1259
My friends and I were working for the bandit, the size of a tangerine.
1260
Oh my god.
1261
Fantastic.
1262
Too good.
1263
I really enjoyed the second story much more than the first.
1264
"Some men just want a tangerine" BRAVO!
1265
The Dark Knight a movie by David Lynch
1266
Goddamn this shit had me rollin.

REPOST and a rip-off of FallOnYourSword's original "Tangerine" video from a while ago.

"A system in which the daily debasement of human potential and dignity becomes not only acceptable, but perhaps even profitable."
1271
this spoke to me on a very personal level.
1272
im getting this again.
1273
Do you have the TSP report on that?
1274
ONE !, ONE! sad person.
1275
MWAHAHAHAHA!
1276
"Walkabout" has a similar plot but it involves a 16 year old girl and her brother are abandoned in the Austrailian Outback.
1277
They meet a teenage Aboriginal and he helps them get out.
1278
There is underage nudity if that rings a bell.
1279
In "Fortress" An Australian school teacher and her students are kidnapped.
1280
She and the children fight for their lives and try to escape from their captors.
1281
It's still a wonder why people think her lips are fake.
1282
Reminds me of the cover of Contra.
1283
She looks dehydrated and malnourished here.
1284
I know models and actresses will regularly do things like this, especially when they're young adults, but yeesh!
1285
Look, I like Angelina Jolie as much as the next guy, and she's a fantastically talented actress, but even at this age you can tell she's potentially batshit crazy.
1286
I wonder if she ever looks back at her old photos; what goes through her mind?
1287
She looks like a lecherous producer's dream.
1288
Looks like a chola
1289
Octomom?
1290
I can't even imagine how many red gels were used for lighting this film.
1291
They essentially lit this film how they would with any other noir and city film, but clamped on those color filter gels to the various fresnels and pars to tint the color temperature down to 700 K - 1000 K.
1292
It literally says this in the dialogue, a Chevy Impala in order to blend in with the other cars.
1293
Chevrolet Impala I think.
1294
yeah if memory serves its a mid aughts impala
1295
Yeah it looks nice and the shots are beautiful but I don't see the point in it really.
1296
It's like Tree of Life just without a story or even documentary element.
1297
Better suited to a short film format.
1298
Sure pretty pictures are nice but I don't want to watch them for the length of a feature film, you need something else to engage the viewer and keep them interested.
1299
Quite a shallow, one dimensional concept.
1300
I guess the Joker's reaction during the hospital scene wasn't improvised after all, as many articles have claimed.
1301
Have watched everything now.
1302
Pretty cool.
1303
Fuck yes, thanks.
1304
Watching this almost as gripping as the movie itself.
1305
It's amazing, the amount of work they've put into making the film.
1306
Watching the MSM getting smashed during the armored car chase was painful.
1307
This comment is for future me: I'm at 20:00, gotta go to work :/
1308
Anything by studio ghibli really

I think that came out last year.
1312
Grave of the Fireflies
1313
Perfect Blue
1314

1315
Redline's pretty awesome, action-wise.
1316
Story's nothing too special, but again, holy shit, the action.
1317
Sword of the Stranger (2007) Patlabor (1989) Patlabor 2 (1993)
1318

The Secret World of Arrietty.
1325
It's one of the most recent Ghibli films, and it is marvelous.
1326
Can't believe no-one has mentioned this yet: Vampire Hunter D. Make sure you watch this in conjunction with Ninja Scroll seeing as they're both AMAZING and directed by the same guy.
1327
Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence It's a standalone movie independent of other Ghost in the Shell movies, and it's somewhat dense, DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN and very good.
1328
Ninja Scroll.
1329
One of the greats.
1330
Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal.
1331
One of my all time favorites.

1334
Fist of the North Star!
1335
Cowboy Bebop: The Movie.
1336
The King of Eden and Paradise Lost are two short films that resolve the series, Eden of the East.
1337
If you haven't seen it, the series is so short you can watch it in one or two sittings.
1338
The series, and the two movies, are amazing.
1339
On the same note as your post, I'm sure you'll like anything by Miyazaki
1340
Yeah any studio ghibli movie is great.
1341
Castles in the Sky is one of my favorites.
1342
Also on netflix streaming, there is a hidden gem called Origin: Spirits of the Past that I thought was surprisingly great.
1343
I really enjoy the Detective Conan Movies, but that may be because I love(d) the series and mangas.
1344
My favorite movie is "The Raven Chaser".
1345
Mind Game, Kara no Kyoukai, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, anything from Satoshi Kon.
1346
Akira, cowboy bebop the movie, escaflowne, blood: the last vampire, and even though people don't like it I love MD Geist for its cheesy 80's vibe and over the top violence.
1347
There are a lot of cool movies and those are just a few I really like
1348
Look for something called Shinjuku Demon City.
1349
I liked it a lot.
1350
Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.
1351
It's set to Daft Punk's album Discovery, which is a must-listen for any lover of electronic music.
1352
Spirited Away is amazing.
1353
I recommend all of Studio Ghibli's films.
1354
Some are kind of long or not quite as awesome but of the ones I've seen Kiki's Delivery Service and The Cats Return are also amazing.
1355
Edit: Almost forgot.
1356
If you just get bored gogoanime.com is an anime site and has a specific section for anime movies if you feel like searching.
1357
There might be better sites but this one is free and generally a good source for online anime.
1358
Both ghost in the shell films, and trio of short films called memories, patlabour the movie, animatrix has some great stories, the cyber city collection (if you like cyberpunk this is quintessential), battle angel alita.
1359
Cowboy Bebop the movie
1360
Anything Ghibli, Redline, Summer Wars, anything Satoshi Kon, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop the Movie, Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade
1361
The Secret World of Arrietty, Ponyo, and My Neighbor Totoro.
1362
If you're into the Halo canon, the series of animated Halo movies are pretty decent.
1363
Grave of the Fireflies is a sobering experience; however it helps me understand the plight that my grandma went through, so it has a special place in my library.
1364
Final Fantasy: Advent Children.
1365
Although mentioned earlier, Ghost in the Shell is a personal favorite.
1366
The opening sequence to that movie still gives me chills.
1367
batman year oneor gotham knight
1368
The evanglion remakes movie (1.0 and 2.0) are so good I recommend people watch those instead of the series.
1369
Evangelion 1.11 and 2.22, simply phenomenal, and the third one is supposed to come out this fall
1370
The castle of Cagliostro.
1371

Miniseries that's worth of damn: Giant Robo.
1373
Read or Die is great, as is FLCL
1374
The first Fullmetal Alchemist movie was pretty good.
1375
Akira, Ghost in the Shell (the first one), Evangelion 1.11 and Evengelion 2.22
1376
I found Crash to be quite realistic.
1377
The casual racism made it seem pretty real to me.
1378
I hear that it over the place IRL but I rarely see it portrayed in film.
1379
Vanilla Sky and Stay

You can find this in the sporting goods department.
1385
That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1386
Retails for about a hundred and nine, ninety five.
1387
It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel, and a hair trigger.
1388
That's right.
1389
Shop smart.
1390
Shop S-Mart.

Hudson Hawk for one.
1395
And this one is on really thin ice.
1396
The Avengers with sean connery, uma thurman, and I forget.
1397
It's supposed to be silly, so enjoy it.
1398
It's a silly mod(70s modern?) movie spoof.
1399
How bout the fact that he doesn't get disintegrated by a nuclear warhead?
1400
Sounds like good proof to me.

Jim Cunningham in Donnie Darko is one of my favorite characters in general.
1409
Point Break.
1410
Dalton cleaning up the Double Deuce, one scumbag at a time.
1411
Roadhouse
1412
Fuck.
1413
I had absolutely no idea he was dead.
1414
I liked him in every role.
1415
"Ghost" is still my favorite because I've just seen that movie SO many times.
1416
"Point Break" is freaking fantastic though, as is "Red Dawn" in a campy way.
1417
Wolverines!
1418
red dawn is my absolute favorite movie of his and to be quite honest.
1419
i think chris hemsworth is going to do a terrible job in the new one.
1420
Come on, think about it.
1421
This was never about money for us.
1422
It was about us against the system.
1423
That system that kills the human spirit.
1424
We stand for something to those dead souls inching along the freeways in their metal coffins.
1425
We show them that the human spirit is still alive. .
1426
So you trust me? .
1427
Okay.
1428
Then don't worry about this guy.
1429
I know exactly what to do with him.
1430

Anybody can write something like this.

1434
It looks pretty cheesy but fuck it ill still see it for the hell of it.
1435
looks exceedingly average
1436
THERES A NEW RED DAWN MOVIE?
1437
Hoping it'll be good after 5 beers.
1438
I'm sure it won't have the same impact as the original, but I'm confident that it will still be a fine movie.
1439
Apologies to fans of the original, but for me I found it laughable as I watched the trailer.
1440
The Cold War has been over for years, so now lets fear the.North Koreans!
1441
It just felt wrong and pathetic.
1442
After just watching red dawn about 2 months ago and then seeing the trailer about a week ago im excited, it really seems like it will be the exact same movie.
1443
A lot of the scenes were seen from the original appeared, the dialogue was quite similar, and i dont think the cast is bad.
1444
As for the story, ya i can see that it might be lacking but overall i think it will be worth watching.
1445
I thought it was a movie of its time and would not work in a contemporary setting; however, the trailer, surprisingly, makes it seem very watchable.
1446
That nothing is going to stop Hollywood from eventually remaking every movie rather than take the chance on new ideas.
1447
I'm sure they'll eventually get around to Dr Strangelove, only this time it will be a bioweapon developed by Iran and they'll find a way to shoehorn a love interest into it.
1448
Out of Sight, Point Break, Almost Famous, The Big Chill, Boogie Nights, Gross Pointe Blank, Jaws, Last Days of Disco (any Whit Stillman really), My Cousin Vinny, The Player, Royal Tenenbaums, Rules of the Game, Slap Shot, Tremors, True Romance, What About Bob?
1449
Well, The Social Network kind of did the whole college thing right, well besides that fact that no college setting is that eerie, and filled with Nine Inch Nails music.
1450
Schoolwork is going to take up about 80% of your time, and you should actually go to class.
1451
Everybody has sex.
1452
Every college movie ever.
1453
'Accepted'.
1454
Everything about that movie.
1455
The one with Mathew Modine and Phoebe Cates: That college girls walk around their dorm buildings in sexy lingerie.
1456
Robot House doesn't really exist.=(
1457
Why has no one mentioned Animal House?
1458
No one in college movies seems to get athletes foot from the shared showers.
1459
Nice try.MYTHBUSTERS.
1460
poop
1461
everybody gets their dingy wet at some point
1462
Well, perhaps they aren't films, but I HAVE to say it.
1463
All those back-to-school ads depicting perfectly decorated dorm rooms with lots of space and perfect lighting and roommates whose decor choices actually coordinate are nowhere near being even remotely accurate.
1464
Big parties are never as interesting as they appear in the movies.
1465
Sure, there's dancing (read: grinding), beer pong, and kegs.
1466
But it's a lot of standing around, not knowing anyone.
1467
In my experience, the best parties are the ones that are smaller than 20 people, where you might actually know more than half the people there.
1468
This was my favorite movie when I was a kid, and I completely forgot that it existed!
1469
I've got to rewatch this.
1470
Pale Rider: sledgehammer.
1471
I like all of the following, but not many agree: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 Willow Predator 2 The Last Boy Scout (RIP Tony Scott) Mallrats The Lost World: Jurassic Park Blade Blade II Cloverfield Death Proof Watchmen Machete Predators Iron Man 2 Prometheus
1472
I love Daredevil.
1473
Most comic fans jump down my throat when i say that i liked it.
1474
Superbad always struck me as pretty realistic.
1475
Sure, their jokes are better, but I thought the way they insult each other and their stupid reactions feel natural.
1476
Nice.
1477
However, the majority of the footage comes from the last quarter of the film.
1478
George Lucas doing a movie that doesn't shatter our childhood dreams.
1479
I'd love to see Charlie Kaufman tackle Kafka on the Shore.
1480
Alejandro Jodorowsky should make a film starring the cast from both Machete movies.
1481
In fact he should co-direct with Robert Rodriguez and the two of them should battle each other during every take.
1482
Clint Eastwood to do a Superhero movie.maybe the Punisher with Killer lines.Clint can be real gritty.
1483
Nolan to do a war epic.
1484
Darren Aronofsky, Robocop.
1485
For me it would be interesting to see a serious drama by Tarantino or a comedy by Paul Thomas Anderson
1486
I'd like to see the Coen brothers recreate The Blues Brothers
1487
Edgar Wright doing a total Noir movie.
1488
Judge Dredd by Paul Verhoeven.Ultraviolent action with a good mix of satire.
1489
Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me was definitely Lynch's most horrific film.
1490
I wanna see Duncan Jones do a superhero movie.
1491
I want tarantino to make a movie about this guy
1492
Lost Highway
1493
Nah.
1494
Magnolia
1495
Hobo With A Shotgun
1496
Fuck yeah, another Jessica Bork film!
1497
I met the director of this film last week
1498
The Departed is filled with wonderful dialogue which is most of the time very realistic.
1499
SPOILERS- this is a great intense scene, dialogue below: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocr0aNwQvVg 1- FREEZE!
1500
2- Hey, hey, hey put the fucking gun down!
1501
Put the gun, put the gun down alright I came here to talk some sense- 1- HANDS! 2- Alright, just act professional, I can get you your money, just- 1- What did you say? 2- I can get you your money - -smacked in the face- 1- You didn't come here to talk alright you came here to get arrested.
1502
2- You got fucking tapes of what?
1503
Costello was MY informant!
1504
I was a rat?
1505
Fuck you, prove it!
1506
He was working for me, he was my informant!
1507
1- Shut your fucking mouth, c'mon get up!
1508
2- Oh what is this a citizens arrest?
1509
Blow me.
1510
Alright, only one of us is a cop here Bill.
1511
You understand that Bill, no one knows who you fucking are- 1- WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP! 2- I'm a Sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police, who the fuck are you?
1512
I erased you! 1- You erased me huh? 2- Yeah go ahead shoot a cop Einstein, watch what happens.
1513
1-What would happen is this bullet would go RIGHT THROUGH YOUR FUCKING HEAD! 2- Watch what happens!
1514
1- What so you can get the parade, huh?
1515
The bagpipes and bullshit?
1516
FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU I'M FUCKING ARRESTING YOU! 2- That's the stupidest thing you could do! 1-SHUT THE FUCK UP!
1517
The dialogue in Clerks is painfully close to how my friends and I talk to each other.
1518
I really think that Reservoir Dogs doesn't have very realistic dialogue.
1519
This holds true for most Tarantino films.
1520
The dialogue is awesome and really entertaining, probably my favorite part of a Tarantino movie, but it's not authentic.
1521
Nobody I've ever met actually talks like that.
1522
There are more pauses and awkward stammering, more unfunny/off-topic comments, less encyclopedic knowledge of whatever topic they're discussing, etc. Tarantino dialogue isn't how people talk It's how people WISH they could talk.
1523
Take a normal conversation you have in a bar, make everybody slightly more witty, remove all of the inane comments, remove the pauses where each person tries to think of something funny to say, then you have a Tarantino conversation.
1524
La Haine, great french movie basicly about 3 multicultural youths in the innercity living their day by doing shenanigans.
1525
They curse alot but don't mean it, they crack jokes, discuss about life philosophies and help eachother go through shit.
1526
True friendship that I can relate to
1527
kids
1528
Paranoid Park has realistic dialogue and actually uses actors who are the same age as their characters.
1529
There's lots of stammering, ums-and-errs, and misunderstandings.
1530
Most of Gus Van Sant's movies are like this, actually.
1531
If you like truly realistic dialogue, I'd recommend looking into his films.
1532
Suprised no one has said Primer yet.
1533
That movie feels like you are listening in on real conversations.
1534
The Town is pretty authentic in its conversation.
1535
I've met a number of convicted criminals through my father, and it's pretty spot on.
1536
Reservoir Dogs is a post-modernist film, though, so it's hard to recommend post-modernist film against regular movies simply because the whole idea of post-modernism is to address philosophical things (like Jules' "miracle" situation in Pulp Fiction etc), and present that logically.
1537
Check out Casino, The Goodfellas, and even Loathing in Las Vegas.
1538
They're all pretty good post-modernist films (the first two contain post-modernist ideology and cinematography, not so much the discussion), and Loathing in Las Vegas has some of the best writing ever.
1539
I don't know if this is the right place to bring this up, but I feel like The Wire (TV show) is the best answer to your question.
1540
I couldn't watch any television shows for a while after that one, and you'll develop a hatred for overexposition, which was terrible in TDKR.
1541
"The CleanSlate, huh?
1542
You want that?
1543
Let me explain it to you at length even though you're willing to kill for it.
1544
Oh yeah, it's totally not real, also."
1545
Good Will Hunting
1546
Everyone in all three of the Nolan Batverse talks in monologues.
1547
I'm not complaining, because I enjoy it a lot.
1548
Mike Leigh's films have very authentic dialogue, although as (mostly) small character based dramas that's to be expected.
1549
21 Jump Street actually did a really good job with making the conversations more realistic and genuine
1550
There's a reason why movies don't have realistic dialogue.
1551
Realistic is boring.
1552
Chronicle?
1553
Underappreciated movie in general, but The Full Monty has what my English friends tell me is some of the most authentic conversational dialogue in terms of British English.
1554
Coffee and Cigarettes
1555
12 Angry Men
1556
The films of John Cassavetes (who most people know as the husband in Rosemary's Baby or the contrarian convict in The Dirty Dozen) feature naturalistic dialogue and acting, although often the emphasis on constant emotional histrionics becomes a bit melodramatic.
1557
Great films though.
1558
Zero Day and Kids, hands down.
1559
Blue Valentine was pretty spot on.
1560
Bizarrely enough, the most realistic movie dialogue I've seen recently was in Magic Mike.
1561
I have new respect for Channing Tatum's skill as an actor because I've never seen anyone so realistically stammer and trip over his words through a particular emotional 'I fucked up, I'm sorry, I'm angry at myself' scene.
1562
No monologuing, just those incomplete angry half-sentences and half finished thoughts that people have when they're trying to understand a shitty situation they've gotten themselves into.
1563
Glengarry Glen Ross.
1564
A David Mamet masterpiece.
1565
edit: spelling
1566
I think Charlie Kaufmann movies have the most realistic dialogue.
1567
and they're pretty friggin clever too.eternal
1568
sunshine
1569
Obviously Pulp Fiction.
1570
Requiem for a Dream
1571
What about Quentin Tarantino films?
1572
I thought Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction both had realistic/humanistic dialogues.
1573
Most Tarantino movies I guess.
1574
Pulp fiction
1575
Cannibal Holocaust showed real killings of animals (turtle etc) - and the director had to go to court to prove that he didn't kill any actors in the film because they thought it was a snuff film of sorts.
1576
Die Hard and Gremlins are the quintessential Christmas movies.
1577
I thought it was very realistic and held the suspense well.also it made me want to bathe in hand sanitizer
1578
Demetri Martin
1579
Saw it on Netflix.
1580
It's a really fun movie.
1581
Glad to see other people enjoy it.
1582
Didn't think it was popular at all.
1583
In Apocalypse Now, the water buffalo that was slaughtered in the end was real.
1584
I think i notice something new in this film every time i watch it.
1585
"He sends ome of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!" - Mallone, The untouchables.
1586
Evil child robot termimator thing in Screamers, all it says is "can i come with you?" even to this day when i see it im like, ehhh, dont take it with you for christs sake!
1587
I guess I have to disagree with the general consensus here.
1588
The pacing and didn't really work well IMO for a teaser and I had a few technical qualms as well.
1589
The dip to black was way overused.
1590
A few cross dissolves between shots would have helped let the images breath a little.
1591
The fades themselves we also too quick and the black stayed up too long.
1592
Finally, the editor must have wanted to give it a feeling of legitimacy (as is indicated by the MPAA frame at the beginning) but then there was no title, release date, or any info of any kind.
1593
Mediocre execution, but interesting concept!
1594
That was bad-ass
1595
Last scene with Vador and Luke is so good !
1596
Chills all over my body.
1597
Really really good, but got to say, found it hard to actually hear some of the lines at the start.
1598
Goosebumps all over my body.
1599
Fantastic job!
1600
One thing though.
1601
Some of the lines can be hard to hear sometimes, especially Yoda's voice.
1602
Neat
1603
Really good stuff.
1604
I was trying to imagine watching this from the POV of somebody who had seen Star Wars but didn't already know this movie.
1605
This felt like a second release trailer for the film, following an earlier, shorter one that would have been more about the space scenes and the hunt for the Falcon.
1606
This made Empire look like a standalone film, counting on the audience to recognize the characters and realize it's a sequel.
1607
Of course that fits modern sensibilities pretty well, too.
1608
But I don't want to take away from this.
1609
Really beautiful.
1610
If you improved the voiceover, that would be awesome
1611
Very nice.
1612
Though, in reality, a modern trailer would have shown Han in carbonite, not to mention Vader cutting off Luke's hand and explaining his parentage.
1613
Great job - take the other posters suggestions on volume, also possibly include some chewie roaring in the prison room?
1614
I think the term you're looking for in the title is "modern".
1615
"Contemporary" means this is a teaser trailer that was played at the time the movie came out.
1616
pretentious student work.
1617
made the movie look and feel more like logan's run than starwars.
1618
david cross and bob odenkirk
1619
The Pest.
1620
I love this post.
1621
Not just a simple "I really like this shot" but a thorough analysis of color, cinematography, makeup and acting.
1622
10/10 would upvote again.
1623
I was hanging out with two friends who I've known for years, and I asked if they'd mind if I put in a movie, despite me never mentioning Dick Tracy before with either of them, when they looked up and realized what was playing, they both stopped what they were doing immediately (Dick Tracy?
1624
Fuck yeah!)and we watched the whole thing.
1625
It'll never get old.
1626
First - I upvoted post for the passion of OP.
1627
Also I'll be the first to admit that, while I enjoy movies, my taste in movies is less than sophisticated.
1628
Now.I hated this movie for the lighting, color palette, and poor direction.
1629
I'm not sure if they wanted a totally contrived feeling, but that's the feeling I get all the way through the movie.
1630
This movie's flaws consistently pull out of the movie watching experience.
1631
I would however like to see it redone.
1632
I think with modern cinematography techniques they could fix every problem that I see in this movie.
1633
I met William Forsythe a two years ago at a horror convention.
1634
I asked him to sign my Dick Tracy DVD.
1635
He was such a nice guy; he even threw in a autographed photo of him as Flattop for free.
1636
DVD and Autograph.
1637
Wow I haven't seen this movie since I was about five years old.
1638
The only thing I remember about it is how I thought Flattop was badass so I always asked for a flattop when I got a haircut hahaa.
1639
I had no idea there was a Dick Tracy movie.
1640
I grew up reading the comics.
1641
Will definitely be looking this up.
1642
When do we eat?
1643
I love the everliving hell out of this movie.
1644
I've seen it so many times, was the first action movie I remember seeing in the theaters everytime I re-watched it as I was growing up I ended up liking it more and more.
1645
Maybe Madonna less and less.
1646
that scene is also one of my favorites.
1647
The make-up in that movie was just nuts.
1648
This is certainly a strange movie, but it's consistent and delivers what it promises.
1649
One of the most visually strong films I've ever seen.
1650
Left an impression on me, especially as a child.
1651
I've always felt this is the movie Joel Schumacher was trying to make with Batman and Robin.
1652
OP has a poor understanding of adjectives.
1653
I loved everything about this movie except Madonna.
1654
Felt the same way about Evita.
1655
She unfortunately keeps those movies on my "almost" great list.
1656
(I realize that this is just my personal bias.)
1657
But don't forget the great songs that Stephen Sondheim wrote for Dick Tracy!
1658
"Big Boy did it"
1659
Wow, this is the kind of post I come to /movies for.
1660
Great stuff.
1661
I've got to watch this movie again as an adult.
1662
Thanks for posting this.
1663
Just checked to see if this movie is out in bluray and excited to learn it's on its way in October.
1664
Excited to buy it!
1665
I really can't believe this hasn't been rated higher 6 hours later if not for the in depth analysis than for the magnificence of the movie itself.
1666
Upvoted and downloading at the same time.
1667
Thank you.
1668
One of my favorite movie specifically for the filming and costuming!
1669
There is not a movie to really compare it to!
1670
Back when they were doing all promos for this Mcdonalds gave away glasses I think with the various mob bosses on them.
1671
I thought these mobsters looked so cool, Flattop etc. Then I see the movie and come to find out the majority of them die right away or are barely in the movie.
1672
I was so pissed.
1673
Dick Tracy is ace, and yeah it wasn't much of a stretch for Madonna to act like an airhead moron.
1674
Look at her now, she's still acting like she's the dogs bollocks.
1675
When in fact she looks like dogs bollocks.
1676
relevant robot chicken
1677
Amazing first picture that you put together and post overall.
1678
now i must watch this movie
1679
Oh boy! Images from this movie have always flashed around in my brain, so glad to finally know where they came from.
1680
Must be close to 20 years since I last saw it.
1681
Now to try to find it online!
1682
Are they going to make an enhanced HD version and rerelease it?
1683
TAKE MY MONEY!
1684
AHHH THE PRUNE FACE IS REAL?
1685
I thought that was just a fucked up dream I had when I was a kid.
1686
Holy fuck my life has changed
1687
I've seen the cover of this film at video stores years ago but had never seen a screenshot from it.
1688
I'm not even sure who Dick Tracy is, character/story/origin wise.
1689
But the screenshots are enough to make me want to see this.
1690
Not on Canadian Netflix, but I have my sources.
1691
WORST MOVIE EVER
1692
Yeah, so it had VERY, VERY basic comic book color contrast like a 6 year old planned the wardrobe and set pieces.
1693
Super impressed I am with the OVER-SIMPLIFIED mise en scene.
1694
That being said: yeah, the movie is okay.
1695
Thank you Disney PR.
1696
So when is that blue ray coming out again?
1697
LEO HAVE MY BABY!
1698
Why does everything have to be a secret military operation?
1699
Dude, this is like cut and paste transformers.
1700
Shia Lebouf = Casey Jones.
1701
Megan Fox = April.
1702
Shredder + Foot = Decepticons.
1703
actually its Teenage Alien Intergalactic Ninja Turtles, also known as TAINT
1704
I like the idea that the government had them locked away or whatever and someone is helping them escape from their clutches, but i hate how it's twisted the idea of what people love about the Turtles in the first place.
1705
Casey Jones should not be the main human character.
1706
Period.
1707
The douchey way he treats them (the colour assigning for instance) was pretty weird, almost like Casey treats them as his pets.
1708
Schrader?
1709
Really!
1710
Come the fuck on.
1711
WE WANT SHREDDER YOU DICKS.
1712
This is blatantly using some kind of template from Transformers, concentrate on the human experience of the unique situation, with no acting or decent script, thus putting the main headline into the background.
1713
I was willing to wait and see where Bay took us with this but i can see that he and his team are complete and utter fuck wits.
1714
A race of alien turtles?
1715
This only angers me, seriously, what bullshit.
1716
And for those sticking up for Bay, saying how he didn't write the script, do you have any idea what a fucking producer does!
1717
Bay probably oversaw the script and pushed his template for so-called success from the Transformers movies onto it.
1718
If you can't see that from reading part of this script then you are insane.
1719
Are studio script writers really this bad?
1720
Wow, this makes the Star Wars prequel scripts look dignified in comparison.
1721
Has no one in the comments posted the Michael Bay Batman script yet?
1722
;D http://my.spill.com/profiles/blog/show?id=947994%3ABlogPost%3A355506
1723
I attempted to read it but when I clicked on the link my computer exploded and proceeded to turn into a Transformer with testicles.
1724
uggg, sounds JUST like the awful treatment Transformers got: Lazy, lowest common denominator tripe, changed from the source material for NO REASON just to piss off fans.
1725
Because what other reason can there be?
1726
"What am I, a kid's toy?"I just got a headache.
1727
The script belongs in r/wtf
1728
If this is real, dear God no.
1729
The Casey and April romance makes me want to rip my eyes out.
1730
Also, the puns, so many puns.
1731
HOLY FUCKBALLS DOES THIS SUCK!
1732
So glad this was cancelled.
1733
It's like the writers were watching an episode of Breaking Bad and said, "Hey, 'Schrader' sounds like 'Shredder'!"
1734
I was just speaking to my girlfriend about the first few paragraphs of this.
1735
The conversation went like this: Me: Hey, Shredder was my nickname in 1st grade.
1736
(my last name is Schrader) Her: That just goes to show you that the writers of this script are just as clever as those same 1st graders.
1737
Dear God.
1738
Teenage Alien Interdimensional Ninja Turtle!
1739
This script literally offended every one of my sensibilities.
1740
May God have mercy on Michael Bay's soul.
1741
I feel like filming this myself but having someone read all of the stage directions and descriptions as a narrator.
1742
Could you imagine some writer coming up with this shit?
1743
EYEFUCK, Legit, These old young lovers, Ready for action, That giant chip
1744
The treatment of the turtle bros is so horrible that I can't really think of one cohesive complaint amidst the clutter of my brain.
1745
But.
1746
Casey.
1747
Casey Jones.
1748
Why, oh why does there need to be the 'normal human white male teenager/young adult' protagonist character with Bay? What's the point of making him the main character like that?
1749
After changing him so goddamn much.?
1750
I've read a few scripts on reddit now and often I see writing like this: "He dragged the subject's LIMP BODY from the restraints while another guy looked at a MONITORING DEVICE" And I ask, is that a scriptwriting technique to indicate what should be shown on screen or is it a cheap, childish way to try and drum up excitement i.e. "and then, around the corner WAS A GIANT DOG!" etc?
1751
Owwww! Right in the childhood.
1752
One thing I missed in the original trilogy was Baxter and Bebop and Rocksteady.
1753
I would like to see them appear if there's a reboot.
1754
I dont think Michael Bay ever intended on making this an actual movie, im convinced he and his writers made this to take a ho tsteamy shit all over TMNT fans hopes and dreams.
1755
Read the whole script what trash fuck Michael Bay
1756
I'm no screen writer, so can someone explain to me why some words seem to be randomly CAPITALIZED?
1757
Michael Bay likes to make changes to canon just because he fucking can and it ussually ends up being really shitty because all Michael Bay can fucking do is make things go boom.
1758
my reaction to hearing the production had been shut downhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjjZGyYcH9E
1759
Wow, the whole thing sounded bad but I had no idea it could reach this level of terrible.
1760
So happy this didn't get made.
1761
Thank fucking god they scrapped it
1762
My eyes are bleeding
1763
realised.
1764
Ironically, Michael Bay filmed my exact response to this script.
1765
MANY FOOTSTEPS.
1766
Sounds almost as good as The Room.
1767
When will everyone just realize that Michael Bay can take any story and turn it into the grandest pile of shit you have ever seen.
1768
I had an idea on how the whole, erhem, alien business went down.
1769
It even had Splinter(in my mind being played as George Takei).
1770
Casey as a small time vigilante, April doing the news.
1771
I even thought out how Shreder was some intergalactic Hitler, hunting down the last of a once mighty race.
1772
Last and not least, the turtles would actually be mutated, but mutated aliens.
1773
Quintessential fall/Halloween film: Hocus Pocus.
1774
The Nightmare Before Christmas- Both Halloween and Christmas.
1775
Shoot 'Em Up is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
1776
i had the dvd to it, the title menu was the infamous scene with donald sutherland, massive spoiler.
1777
I saw this recently.
1778
While it is not better than the original I found it an utterly fascinating and bizarre film.
1779
The ending scene is an absolute classic however.
1780
Sorry I couldn't find a better one, but thought of this right away http://www.selfhelpforhappypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/MarsAttacks.jpg
1781
When you say "the original" do you mean the one with Donald Sutherland (1978), or the one with Kevin McCarthy (1956)?
1782
I've never seen the the 1956 original and always wondered if it's worth watching.
1783
I guess the newest one (Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, 2007) is actually just called "The Invasion" though.
1784
I haven't seen this one.
1785
What the fuck is going on in those pictures!
1786
When i was twelve this was THE SCARIEST MOVIE I had ever seen.
1787
It just made me depressed for about a week.
1788
In other words, thanks jerk.
1789
This was a damn good remake.
1790
Gimme da goosebumps.
1791
I love the trilogy so much
1792
This'll be his fifth with Scorsese.
1793
Only three more to match De Niro.
1794
Stiil looks like this.
1795
DiCaprio really grew into head these last few years.
1796
Scorsese and Dicaprio?
1797
I'm in.
1798
That motherfucker rocks a mean suit.
1799
that fucking coffee cup
1800
Is it me, or does that guy NOT AGE?
1801
My only regret is that I have boneitis
1802
Leonardo's next role: Guy in expensive suit with new slick hairstyle.
1803
Dicaprio 3 my one man crush.
1804
Everyone has a one man crush right?
1805
"MY NAME IS TEDDY DANIELS!"
1806
Will there be a scene which can be made into an upvote gif?
1807
For me it looks like DiCaprio in a suit, that's it.
1808
I understand these "first look" pictures when they show a superhero or some weird looking character, but this one is just a man in a suit.
1809
What is so special about it and why do people like these pictures?
1810
My wife is watching Catch Me If You Can right now in the living room and I just walked by and mentioned that DiCaprio is my favorite lead actor at the moment.
1811
He looks quite young.
1812
This is going back to his "The Aviator" look.
1813
First of all, I think DiCaprio is a fantastic actor.Second of all, has Scorsese ever commented on his love of DiCaprio?
1814
I don't have a problem with it, just wondering.
1815
He's looking preeeetty dapper in this pic.
1816
I'm really excited for this to come out, Jordan Belfort's son (the guy who wrote the book and who the movie is based off) goes to my school.
1817
It'll be interesting to see what he was like before we met him.
1818
This man is fucking ageless.
1819
He looks younger here than he did in Catch Me If You Can.
1820
I need the same baby blood he bathes in STAT.
1821
Why is he such a fabulous man
1822
Is it just me or does he look a little downsy in that picture?
1823
Texan here WTF, DOES EVERY ONE IN NY DRINK OUT OF BLUE COFFEE CUPS WITH GREEK TEXT!
1824
Does this fucker ever age?
1825
Weird with brown hair!
1826
Dude's a great actor.
1827
He is now in elite class as one of the best and this proves it: Gilbert Grape, Departed, Gangs of NY, Catch Me, Aviator, J Edgar, Shutter Island, Inception, Blood Diamond, etc. Who's better in his age range?
1828
I was wondering if they were ever going to make this.
1829
I read the book four years ago, I think it was.
1830
It should be a good one!
1831
The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my favourite books.
1832
I hope they do it justice on screen.
1833
And I hope they show the scene when Jordan takes those 20 year old ludes and drives his car.
1834
That was the funniest shit
1835
"Haters say WHAT?"
1836
Oh sweet, I just read the book which I really enjoyed.
1837
Cannot wait to see DiCaprio's interpretation.
1838
Are you sure this isn't just Leo walking down the street to a formal business meeting?
1839
Sending the pictures to my tailor now, that suit is happening.
1840
Thank you for the inspiration.
1841
Someone needs to make a movie about Joe Kennedy.
1842
I read this script and he came off as one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read.
1843
Every single shitty Wall Street cliche (coke, whores, being a total douche) wrapped in one person.
1844
Still it's Scorsese so I'm curious about it.
1845
What's the time frame for the storyline?
1846
The suit looks dated.
1847
I bet I can guess what type of accent he's going to use in this movie.
1848
Shit, I still have that book by Jordan Belfort on my shelve.
1849
wrapped in plastic.
1850
Maybe it's time I give it a read.
1851
Starring Leonardo Di Caprio with music by Howard Shore and.oh wait, we only do that with Tim Burton.
1852
I wish I had that suit.
1853
He went to Jared.
1854
And it's a guy in a suit at work.
1855
Hasn't he had this look in, like, 10 movies already?
1856
He's doing that walk again.
1857
I don't get it.
1858
Side question: Those blue coffee cups are in every single damn movie.
1859
Especially ones set in NYC.
1860
Why not Starbucks or something else?
1861
Why blue cups?
1862
What is significance?
1863
I need answer!
1864
Blue cup answer!
1865
Fuck Yea! POWER TIES!
1866
Hmmm don't know.
1867
Wall street is still the best shitty American business guy movie.
1868
I mean I know it's based on a true story and all but Gordon Gecko was such a great asshole.
1869
Will he be able to top it?
1870
I guess I will have to see.
1871
Eh, couldn't be any worse the J Edgar.
1872
is it just me or is that suit really baggy
1873
nice to see him lose the weight.
1874
Those lapels are huuge
1875
I'm excited for this.
1876
Loved the book
1877
I want that suit.
1878
He looks like a Ken doll.
1879
So this takes place in the early 90's?
1880
Looks like he lost weight
1881
It's not a good idea of Scorsese to keep working with the same actor.
1882
Look what it did to Tony Scott.
1883
Too soon?
1884
I met Jordan Belfort once when I worked AV in a hotel.
1885
He's super short and intense.
1886
sounds like more of a Tom Cruise role
1887
I have no clue what this movie is about, but I know it's gonna be good because DiCaprio is in it.
1888
Ah, Leo.
1889
I would let him hold hands the shit out of me.
1890
i'm not gay, but damn
1891
I always love seeing what decade Leo's gonna be acting in next.
1892
80's.nice.
1893
As someone who's never been on the east coast, can someone please explain why all coffee in New York seems to come in those weird little blue cups?
1894
Do those cups even have lids?
1895
He's thinking, "Did I just shard?"
1896
He really wants that little gold statue.
1897
Is that Shia Labeouf in the background?
1898
Without this title its just DiCaprio walking down the street in Inception.
1899
All I hear when I see that title is the theme music to Twin Peaks.
1900
"Are you okay man?"No.
1901
I'm pretty fucking far from okay" - After the infamous rape scene in Pulp Fiction
1902
"You got to ask yourself one question, 'do I feel lucky?', well do ya punk?"
1903
I love watching horror films in the fall, or late summer.
1904
Something about the atmosphere and temperature.
1905
It makes everything scarier
1906
True Lies is one of the best.
1907
The Losers has a good mixture of action & comedy and is very underrated IMO.
1908
Hot Fuzz
1909
Y'know, I haven't seen Wild Wild West since I first saw it in theaters.
1910
I liked it then, but I was still in middle school, so I can't say for sure.
1911
While I didn't care for 2012, I actually did like The Day After Tomorrow.
1912
Never seen She's Out of My League.
1913
Spanglish is probably my best answer to the question though.
1914
Malachi from Children of the Corn is a classic.
1915
More recently, the children/assailants in Them.
1916
Constantine, if only for Keanu Reeves' awesome Holy Shotgun.
1917
Blocked in the US.
1918
I'd also recommend the When We Left Earth documentary series for anyone who hasn't seen it.
1919
It is absolutely fantastic.
1920
Young Anakin, as a forebearer of what would be the decline of a franchine.
1921
The Good Son.
1922
Dude, check out WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011).
1923
Kid is pretty evil.
1924
After reading this, I see why the movie sucked.
1925
Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
1926
The Napa Valley killings in Zodiac.
1927
Kevin Spacey as Booth
1928
Keep in mind Booth was only 27 when he shot Lincoln.
1929
Franco would be the best choice of all those listed.
1930
I would love to see Bryan Cranston or Gary Oldman as Booth.
1931
Casey Affleck as Booth!
1932
He'd do a great job.
1933
If you're looking for a good actor who isn't as big, maybe Ben Foster.
1934
Ben Hur.
1935
UPDATE: I'm calling my dad.
1936
All those years he's told me to "look it up" but I took him at his word.
1937
I've been Snoped!

1950
I watched this on a plane and about 30 minutes in, someone in the row ahead started coughing.
1951
instant horror
1952
Terrifying and realistic.
1953
I assembled a small cache of emergency food and supplies immediately after seeing it.
1954
I found it to be ridiculous, actually.
1955
A lot of the lines were straight-up corny and I had a really hard time taking it seriously.
1956
I was disappointed because I thought the cast had a lot of potential.
1957
Freaked me right the fuck out.
1958
Enjoyed how science ended up saving the day
1959
I thought it was fantastic.
1960
A very restrained and subtle "scary" movie.
1961
The fact that the disease isn't some super ebola didn't break my suspension of disbelief and made the movie all the more terrifying.
1962
Loved the ending.
1963
I thought the ending was a let down.
1964
Throughout the whole movie it's a world wide epidemic and the world is dying.
1965
Then all of a sudden "WE FIXED IT!".
1966
I found it exceptionally realistic and just frickin' awesome!
1967
I also sometimes watch it just for the music score.
1968
Felt like "outbreak" but more believable.
1969
Didnt care for it overall, just liberal crap.
1970
8 Legged Freaks.
1971
It was the first 'scary' (horror-comedy) movie I had ever seen.
1972
It's the most popular "film" running at my theater 3 days straight.
1973
All 30-90 white people.
1974
Do you know how many CHILDRENS' tickets I've torn for this movie!
1975
It's surprising what a little hate and a lot of money will get you.
1976
I associate the third Harry Potter movie with winter, because ABC family always shows it during the winter.
1977
Good Will Hunting always struck me as an autumn movie.
1978
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - This movie seems to be an Autumn/Winter themed movie (ties in well with the depiction of the ending/end of a relationship).
1979
Christmas time.Home Alone for sure.
1980
Star Wars with summer, more specifically end of May.
1981
I love watching any black and white movie when it's either raining or snowing.
1982
JAWS in the summer.
1983
It started when there was a Jaws marathon on during a summer vacation in Mexico when I was little, but seriously no movie gets me more pumped for summer.
1984
Years ago I spent a spring watching The Fellowship of the Ring almost every night next to my bedroom window with a warm breeze coming through.
1985
It seemed to be a good fit.
1986
Also, The Sandlot is the ultimate summer movie for my friends and I.
1987
No matter how old we get, it's a must watch at least once during the summer.
1988
The Wrestler-Late November
1989
Non-religious winter movie is The Thing.
1990
The first snowy or really cold day of the year is the day I watch The Thing.
1991
The movie has slightly more impact on me when I know it's cold outside.
1992
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.and
1993
Spring feels a bit more like a spring movie than any other season.
1994
Don't know why.
1995
I always watch 'Cool Runnings' before the winter Olympics.
1996
Good tradition.
1997
Independence Day on July 4th (Summer).
1998
That speech.
1999
I watch the baseball movies in fall (play-off time) instead of spring (training camp & season opener time).
2000
For autumn I immediately think of Plains, Trains, and Automobiles.
2001
Groundhog Day - Groundhog Day
2002
Dazed and Confused is the perfect spring movie.
2003
The sense of endless opportunity, the risk-taking, the heightened sexuality, the camraderie, and the feeling of freedom, sweet freedom.
2004
I can transport myself to the last day of school instantly by putting this movie on.
2005
Super-hero movies in the summer
2006
You've Got Mail is an autumn movie, because of the bouquet of freshly sharped pencils line.
2007
I always watch Dazed and Confused right at the start of summer, and Stand By Me right as it finishes.
2008
Home alone=Christmas break is here!

Winter, Christmas movies, bad comediesSpring, Rom-Coms, family dramas Summer, Blockbusters, feel good kids movies Fall, Horror movies, Dramas

My favorite is seldom mentioned-- Arlington Road.
2028
Pi. Or anything else by Darren Aronofsky, but Pi is a personal favorite (though I've only seen it and Black Swan, but I digress).
2029
A Beautiful Mind is more of a drama than a thriller, but it has elements you will enjoy if you like psychological aspects of movies.
2030
Frailty.
2031
I am not religious.
2032
It's a horror movie about religion with a deep psychological theme.
2033
" If God is for us, who can be against us?" Romans 8:31 Don't let anyone give away the ending.
2034
Black Swan.
2035
My god, that movie.
2036
Movies in that take you inside the mind of a crazy person a la Shutter Island: Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream, Memento, American Psycho, Mulholland Dr, A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, Moon, Vertigo, The Shining, Inception.
2037
The Jacket!
2038
Wow, nobody has mentioned either of my two favorites.
2039
Pans Labyrinth and The Orphanage.
2040
Granted Pans Labyrinth isnt quite as much a thriller, but it does have its moments.
2041
Both of theses are great films, but make sue you get the subtitled versions.
2042
Primer
2043
Agreed with Black Swan.
2044
Also I highly recommend Julia's eyes!
2045
Every suggestion in this thread is amazing, watch them all.I will.
2046
Thank you r/movies
2047
The first Saw.
2048
I'm pretty sure it was intended to be a stand alone film, but then hollywood got it's grubby stubs on it.
2049
I haven't seen "A Simple Plan" in a long time, but I recall it being quite good.
2050
Very good for escalating levels of tension.
2051
Mulholland Dr
2052
Timecrimes (Los cronocrímenes)
2053
Airborne.
2054
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MartinMcDonagh
2055
Martin McDonagh is a bad motherfucker.
2056
The Lieutenant of Inishmore is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a theater.
2057
The dude is arguably the most important living playwright right now.
2058
So, yeah, I'm excited for this film.
2059
Yes and yes.
2060
The best part of the trailer is by far the "eye of the last guy left" part at the end, which is hilarious.
2061
Otherwise, it doesn't seem that funny
2062
The Last Samurai
2063
Macgruber
2064
In addition to the movies OP listed, I'd have to say my favorite movie that is generally disliked is Semi Pro.
2065
It's just the funniest shit out there IMHO.
2066
Grind
2067
Judge Dredd
2068
Robin Hood, the 2010 Ridley Scott version
2069
I imagine on reddit I will have a lot of people agree with me but Baseketball is truly an amazing comedy.
2070
Waterworld
2071
The Postman
2072
Just Friends
2073
Land of the Lost
2074
Matrix Reloaded, Revolutions I generally disregard, but Reloaded is a quality film to me
2075
Titan A.E
2076
Observe and report.
2077
Cabin Boy
2078
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer."
2079
I'm a HUGE fan of the show (which has a great cult following) AND a huge fan of the movie (in which no one ever seems to get the joke.)
2080
Paul Rubens makes me laugh so hard I could cry whenever I rewatch it.
2081
I don't know why people get the humor on the show but not the movie.
2082
Yes the show injected more drama, but they were equally sardonic.
2083
The Girl Next Door
2084
Van Helsing with Hugh jackman.
2085
I'm a sucker for automated crossbows.
2086
The Rush Hour trilogy
2087
"The Expendables".
2088
Yes, it was pretty much panned by the critics, but the combination of stereotypical heroes (with names like Barney, Paine, & Hale Caesar) & anti-heroes (Gunnar & Tool) combined with a weak plot made for a great escapist movie.
2089
I didn't love it but i really like the green hornet
2090
Predator 2.
2091
Suburban Commando
2092
Kung-Pow, Hot Rod, Brain Donors.
2093
People just don't like silly movies for some reason.
2094
Speed Racer.
2095
Love the look of the movie especially.
2096
It's like a live-action cartoon.
2097
I'd say Watchmen.
2098
Alot of people don't like it for being too long, and being unfaithful to the graphic novel, but I love it.
2099
Dune - 1984.
2100
People used to love it as it has cult status but recently I have seen some silly comments like "why so far into the future are they so low tech"?
2101
Apparently people have forgotten what steampunk is.
2102
Superman Returns.
2103
I have never and will never understand the hate for this.
2104
Yeah, it wasn't the slam-bang, action extravaganza that some people were expecting.
2105
But it had so much heart, and was so beautifully constructed.
2106
Superman's epic rescue of the crashing plane, Kevin Spacey's fun performance, Routh's dead-on channeling of Christopher Reeve, the excellent John Ottman score paying strong homage to Williams.
2107
I get that the pacing in certain sequences could have been tightened up a bit, and the existence of spoilers Superman's kid was controversial at best.
2108
But come ON!
2109
It was not a BAD movie by any stretch!
2110
Plus, Brian Singer's vision for a sequel was a Wrath of Khan to SR's Star Trek Motion Picture, something that was an extremely enticing prospect.
2111
And now we'll never know.
2112
Super Mario Bros. and The Village
2113
Pretty much everything by M. Night Shyamalan except Avatar: The Last Airbender.
2114
I even enjoy Lady in the Water if I'm alone and don't feel judged for it.
2115
Grandma's Boy.
2116
With most people it was pretty forgettable at best, but I love it.
2117
Miss March, Cloverfield, and Hitman
2118
Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.
2119
Everyone I know hates that film to their very core, but I had so much fun when I saw it (I was with friends, and we were making fun of it, slightly.
2120
Not the entire time though).
2121
It was campy, had some neat ideas, and was unlike anything else at the time.
2122
Not to mention it was also one of the first truly pure CGI /special effects films.
2123
I keep telling everyone to re-watch it and expect absolutely nothing, turn off your brain and enjoy it.
2124
Strange Wilderness.
2125
Greatest movie of all time.
2126
0% on rottentomatoes.
2127
fucking ass holes.
2128
The Postman - haters can suck it!

2140
Mel Gibson is still a great actor in my eyes.
2141
Xanadu (but everybody loves the soundtrack)
2142
Death To Smoochy
2143
Not the best Superman movie, but I think Brandon Routh made a damn good Superman.
2144
Sahara
2145
The third mummy movie
2146
Shoot Em Up, Across the Universe, Cloverfield, Saw, Rent, The Adjustment Bureau, Blood and Chocolate to name a few.
2147
sucker punch the day after tomorrow Superman Returns
2148
Army of Darkness, no respect for Bruce
2149
Watched 'Lost in Translation' with some family members and they didn't get it.
2150
I love that movie.
2151
Robojocks "You make my drink taste liiiike blaauhd" *attempt at Russian accent in writing
2152
My husband and I watched that this week too and found it to be a wonderful movie.
2153
We too thought it would just be a silly comedy but ended up loving it for Jeff's character.
2154
In about 10 years, I'd love to see a different treatment of Cowboys & Aliens.
2155
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
2156
Rape scene.
2157
My god.
2158
Didn't their batteries last for 120 years?
2159
EDIT: Yup.:) http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Series800#Technicaldata
2160
In T2 he says his cell can last for 120 years
2161
obviously its magic
2162
Rampage Was expecting a god-awful Uwe Boll movie, and I got a decent to good movie.
2163
Every single one involving Jar Jar.
2164
It must be a drinking game, or else it is not a survivable film.
2165
Yeah, I own it.
2166
Have you seen Val Kilmer's recent stuff?
2167
I think Brando was at the stage of his life where he was on a diet of donuts and pain killers, and was doing anything for money (like shitting on glass tables for clients).
2168
Ultimately though, isn't it the directors fault?
2169
We read the book for my english class earlier this year.
2170
Loved it.
2171
To fill up a lesson, we watch the movie.
2172
Hated it.
2173
I'm wondering as well how that movie turned out that poorly.
2174
I was in an acting camp when I was 9, and we performed the "play version" of this.
2175
I was Dr. Moreau.
2176
What is pathetic is that A 9 year old could pull off Dr. Moreau better than Vito Fucking Corleone.
2177
I think it just shows Brando's sad decline as he aged.
2178
What's the context?
2179
Crazy, Stupid, Love.
2180
Was expecting a mediocre at best movie, thought it was fantastic.
2181
50/50.
2182
It was marketed as kind of a buddy comedy with cancer in it, while there were funny parts, I did not expect such an emotional roller-coaster.
2183
I thought Iron Sky was going to be terrible because I had so many comments saying that it has terrible jokes and just seems shitty all around, but I thought the comedy was excellent, the CGI looked amazing for a movie with a budget smaller than Chronicle's (9 million (7.5 million euros) for the former, 15 million for the latter).
2184
Also, I thought Chronicle would be pretty bad because of the whole found footage/handheld camera gimmick, but it ended up being great.
2185
Mysterious Skin.
2186
I didn't do much research on it, just watched the trailer before watching.
2187
It mentioned something about aliens, so I thought it'd be nice to watch during a movie marathon I was having with friends.
2188
Turned out to be a fantastic drama that I loved, and is on the way to being on my favorites list.
2189
Exit Through The Gift Shop.
2190
Talk about a weird, but cool movie!
2191
Pan's Labyrinth.
2192
I knew nothing about it when I started watching it.
2193
I wasn't prepared to be so horribly depressed.
2194
I ended up burying my face in my husband's shoulder and cried through the majority of the movie.
2195
The tragedy of that movie stuck with me for days.
2196
On a brighter note, I randomly decided to watch the new 21 Jump Street with no expectations and nearly peed my pants I was laughing so hard.
2197
Even the end credits had me crying from laughter.
2198
Got 3 in mind: Blade Runner - I had seen it once when I was maybe 14 and I didn't really think much of it.
2199
Then I watched it with a bunch of friends one night and was totally blown away.
2200
By the end I couldn't remember what I was thinking the first time around, and now its my favorite movie.
2201
Man On Wire - Never in my life expected a documentary to be as engrossing and inspiring as it was.
2202
One of my favorites.
2203
Casino Royale (2006) - Expected a loud and kind of mindlessly entertaining Bond movie, but to this day remains one of my favorites.
2204
The set-piece action scenes were amazing, and even the poker scenes had me on the edge of my seat.
2205
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Now the only reason I saw this was because I wanted to see Brave but the theater was being painted so I saw this instead.
2206
I was expecting this to be extremely, violently terrible, on par with Jack and Jill or Epic Movie.
2207
It turned out to be a good action movie with a really good story.
2208
Now there were some laughably bad parts, but on the whole it was a good movie.
2209
Not what I was expecting.
2210
Men Alone 2: The KY Connection
2211
I believe this is Bruce's best role.
2212
Jarhead
2213
Is this it
2214
Not the same.
2215
Orange and blue are very complimentary, and looks good, but it's something you do as design.
2216
Every scene is made that way on purpose to make the movie have a certain feel over it.
2217
When in the intro of Suits, it's two colors separate from each other, only to represent the difference between the two lawyers.
2218
Even if one of them isn't a laywer.
2219
I've wathec that show closely, the color scheme you're talking about isn't that common in it.
2220
You might be thinking of Neil Marshall's Doomsday.
2221

2222
I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow
2223
There's this great website it's called Google.com you should check it out.
2224
I always think they should do a big budget, all star cast version of "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
2225
Dune.
2226
Even though I seriously enjoy the original Arnold vehicle, I would love to see a slightly less cartoonish "The Running Man" remake.
2227
Dude, Maniac Cop.
2228
Where's my goddamn Maniac Cop remake!
2229
Sneakers.
2230
People might 'get' it more now.
2231
Also, the Shadow.
2232
Man, I loved the style, the premise, the casting, the set pieces.
2233
Shame that somehow it didn't quite come together (seems like large chunks were hacked out of it somewhere.
2234
Is there a 'director's cut'?
2235
Actually, for the Batman reboot I want this: a 'period' version.
2236
Prohibition era Batman.
2237
Tommy-guns, snap-brims hats, fallen 'dames' with a heart of gold.
2238
Seventh Seal, just so the words could be more easily understood.
2239
The translations aren't 100% Good in English.
2240
Even though I'm in love with the original
2241
Citizen Kane In Imax 3d Edit:kidding although it would be interesting to see someone try to update one of those "top all time" sport of films.
2242
More seriously, johny mnemonic.
2243
Yeah paycheck was similar, but it lacked some of the fun from that one.
2244
The Last Starfighter, Dreamscape, Spaceballs, Meteor
2245
The Harry Potter films.
2246
The kids were cast based on appearance, and not acting ability.
2247
The adults held up well, but the movies could only get so far when the titular character and his friends ruined the magic of the scenes.
2248
Had no luck finding this one.
2249
You may want to check out this person's page, and maybe send them an email (his email is on his page):http://allaboutwarmovies.com/
2250
He might have some idea as to what that movie was.
2251
I usually just order one of these off of eBay and send the guy a link of the picture I want printed on it.
2252
The picture has to be 1200 x 2000 pixels (for a large poster like this one).
2253
The poster is "silk cloth" which is really just a flimsier/cheaper type of fabric that you can't get wet otherwise the ink comes off.
2254
For the SUPER cheap price, I have been very happy with his products.
2255
Bought the Joker police car scene 2 years ago, and it's still going strong.
2256
Keep in mind that because it ships from China, it usually takes 2 weeks or longer.
2257

2258
i was surprised to see there was an /r/strangerswithcandy God, I miss that show
2259
I'd have to go with Swingers where Jon Favreau's character (it's been years, I forget his character name) gets home from the bar and calls that girl he met just that night, effs up his message, and then calls back again.
2260
and again.
2261
Digging himself deeper/sounding more pathetic each time.
2262
Finally, she picks up and says like "don't ever call here again."
2263
Ouch.
2264
Painfully awkward.
2265
edit: Here it is
2266
Un Chien Andalou's opening scene.
2267
I still can't handle it nor anything dealing with eye injuries.
2268
Reservoir Dogs torture scene.
2269
I can take it until the ear, then I skip to the next scene and take a break.
2270
Feed.
2271
That movie is just wrong, wrong, wrong.
2272
It's NSFL.
2273
Even though I've only seen it once, the scene in The Passion of the Christ where Jesus is being whipped.
2274
shudder
2275
The rape scene in Boys Don't Cry.
2276
I was looking for the particular scene on Youtube.
2277
It was Pandorum.
2278
After the fight with the mutant, they began running in the cryogenics bay, being chased by more mutants.
2279
Suddenly one of the cryo-capsules emerges, and a bearded man pulls the mask away, only to look down and see a dozen mutants groping for him, hungry for his flesh.
2280
The lieutenant, I think his name was Bower, turns and sees that man.reaching out to him.
2281
A human begging for help.
2282
But he watches him get killed, this unnamed man dying so the three being chased can lived.
2283
Im a grown-ass man and I gasp in horror everytime I see it.
2284
Buried alive scene in Kill Bill (Vol.
2285
2, I think)
2286
That would be pretty friggin' epic.
2287
Grumpy Old Men
2288
Bridges of Madison county; Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood.

Also try lemonparty.org,
2291
it's a classic web short featuring older actors.
2292
This is why we must fight to eliminate religion from the public sphere.
2293
"There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.
2294
What's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code." - Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada 1968-1979, 1980-1984
2295
And yet people consistently question why these kinds of topics are raised by r/atheism.
2296
It's a shame only we seem not to be blind to the many problems of religious faith and are willing to vocally challenge them.
2297
We will keep fighting the good fight despite the people who deride us for it, ignorant to what they are allowing to transpire on their doorstep.
2298
It's a farce.
2299
I wish more could see it.
2300
seriously halfway into reading this all i can think is: how weird is america.
2301
50 years in prison for a blow job.
2302
hahaha that is just outrageous.
2303
i really hope that real change will come soon, but im guessing that the afraid, stuck up, homophobe and simply cruel people in america will continue to strive for power to be able to implement their views and rules, just like they always did. i guess in the end it's about determination, so go out there good people and outnumber al the weirdos in politics.
2304
t might be the only way to really change stuff!
2305
I would like to point out that there is NOTHING conservative about evangelicals.
2306
Their messiah was a lot of things, but conservative was not one of them.
2307
I love how someone tried submitting this to /r/athiesm
2308
What I don't get (as a female) is that why these women were UNAWARE of what these people were doing in Congress.
2309
These people have ALREADY voted on these measures.
2310
They've done it!
2311
Comment below on the article page: My Vagina, My Vote- “GOP, you don’t get either one!?
2312
Priceless and brilliant.
2313
I don't understand.
2314
If someone raped Paul Ryan's wife, would Ryan expect his wife to deliver the baby?
2315
Would this child be lovingly embraced by his family?
2316
Would they invite the rapist over for tea and crumpets and discuss how to raise the child?
2317
excommunicated posted this comment.
2318
the stories in there are a combination of nauseating and mind-boggling.
2319
I love the way that Carlin would talk about those sort of things in his act, but use that tone of voice that made him sound like he was reading a bedtime story to an 8 year old.
2320
RNC Chairman Reince Priebus responds: Goddammit!
2321
For the last fucking time I'm telling you people that just because we're voting a blanket abortion ban in our platform doesn't mean we're actually going to ban abortion!
2322
We didn't do it when we had the senate, house and white house, did we!
2323
For fuck's sake, we're not idiots!
2324
We're just voting that plank in so we can get the support of religious fanatics, hayseeds and assorted other nitwits.
2325
Don't you people understand that, without the fanatics, the GOP is reduced to the likes of the Green Party or Lyndon Larouche lunatics!
2326
What the actual fuck!
2327
Do you broads want us to win or what!
2328
I was dating a woman during the 2008 elections.
2329
I asked her one night who she planned to vote for, and she said McCain/Palin.
2330
I said "but you told me yourself you're amazed he picked such an inexperienced, apparently not-that-bright woman to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency."
2331
She said she couldn't vote for anyone who supported abortion.
2332
She agreed with nothing the McCain ticket stood for, yet still voted for it because of the abortion issue.
2333
Most people are not sufficiently thoughtful to hold to principle.
2334
Most people simply look out for their immediate self interest, without any consideration given to the future.
2335
I'm for the most part, very moderate in my political ideologies.
2336
I am definitely more left than right, but i certainly believe that we need many different views in government.
2337
I love a good, rational and level headed debate with a more conservative person, and know many that i deeply respect.
2338
That said, Romney absolutely terrifies me beyond belief.
2339
As a homosexual, he doubly scares me.
2340
But more than just his (and Ryan's) views on LGBT rights, is his views on the economy, on healthcare and education, and foreign relations that has me so worried.

2342
Here's a great clip where Colbert gets GOP golden boy Dinesh D'Souza to admit as much
2343
They do, constantly; it sounds a lot like "Well, I'm not one of those women, so this has nothing to do with me."
2344
I love how Republicans have no problem with the police kicking down my door and dragging me off to jail for smoking a joint in my living room.
2345
But when they want to ban abortion, that's when they're finally too radical.
2346
These people go on and on about small government and don't even understand what that means.
2347
They don't give a shit about the government intruding on people's private affairs until it could affect them.
2348
It's not a war on women.it's
2349
simply turning women into property.
2350
You can pass zoning laws about what you can and cannot do with property so why can't you do the same to women?
2351
What's wrong with that?
2352
WOW. muslims allow abortion till the 40th day of conception (or 120th i dun remember), and if the baby is endangering the mothers life.
2353
How is this better than them?EDIT: i mean the GOP view of abortion.
2354
In other words, Republicans explain why they vote Republican - they're so one-issue locked that until that one-issue affects them, they don't give a shit how badly it hurts other people.
2355
Oh so maybe now you people will start listening when we tell you the conservative parties of America are nothing but gigantic bombs waiting for the right fuse to come along and will stop at nothing to regress us to the dark ages socially.
2356
In other news, the amount of money spent on strip clubs and hand lotion has more than doubled among Republican men.
2357
Man, I really do dislike most political ads, and this one is no different.

This'll go into the oblivion but.
2359
Women in "Republican Women for Obama" video actually registered Democrats.
2360
This woman is not a Republican but a registered democrat.
2361
See this article http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/republican-in-obama-ad-is-a-democrat
2362
These women all say that at one point they were all Republicans but are now not.
2363
I would say changing your Voter registration is in line with changing your party or is that not what the entire video was about?
2364
She changed her political party.
2365
Thats what the entire video is about.
2366
Women who were republicans who can no longer vote Republican because of their policies against women.
2367
It does (and I think it actually occurs to many people), but they don't want to waste their vote.
2368
If only the masses would start sticking to their principles, then maybe change could actually happen.
2369
Any woman who votes republican now needs a manditory psych eval
2370
Except for the fact that those women are registrated Democrats.
2371
This will more than likely either get downvoted or buried in the sands of time, but offers up at least one of the women featured in Obama's latest ads who has no affiliation with the Republican Party whatsoever as of 2006.
2372
Another instance of a complete lack of research by the Obama reelection team.
2373
but they are southerners.they
2374
must be republican :O

Georgia State Representative Bobby Franklin has introduced a bill that would not only make abortion illegal but would make miscarriages illegal.

Here's a great clip where Colbert gets GOP golden boy Dinesh D'Souza to admit as much.
2378
It's funny that its not until an issue affects some personally in their own lives, do they decide to try and fight for it to be "their" choice, whether it be marijuana, women or gay rights.
2379
I wish the majority of the people would just come to the conclusion that ANYTHING that only affects you and your body, should be your right to choose and NOT the government's.
2380
I agree with the sentiment of the article, but that site is just bad.
2381
It's like the left wing version of Fox.
2382
Just because it's proclaiming a view I agree with doesn't mean it's credible.
2383
I'm not comfortable with such a biased source.
2384
Honestly it's a pretty trashy article.
2385
At one point it says republicans want to make it legal to choose the mother of your children by rape.
2386
That's a horrific misrepresentation, and all of you know better.
2387
For prolifers, it's literally about saving lives.
2388
That's how they think of it.
2389
It has nothing to do with eroding women's rights.
2390
This perceived war on women is an idea that some democrat came up with to polarize people and get votes.
2391
If you buy into all this you're the reason our society is being flushed down a toilet.
2392
She left the GOP to vote Democrat.
2393
That's kind of the whole point of the ad, genius.
2394
It doesn't matter that she didn't leave the GOP yesterday.
2395
Those women are Registered Democrats.
2396
Now they are.
2397
Which is the reason behind the ad.
2398
Lifelong republicans change to democrat.
2399
Too subtle?
2400
Because they're not stupid?
2401
The gang that couldn't shoot straight.
2402
No matter where you stand on gun politics, we need to force the NYPD to re-evaluate their training and especially their use of modified, heavy triggers on their firearms: From user /u/wewd in /r/news.
2403
When the NYPD switched from Smith & Wesson revolvers, which had about a 12 lb trigger pull, to Glock semiautomatics, which have a 5.5 lb trigger pull, the NYPD found that their officers were having a high incidence of negligent discharges due to the lower weight trigger pull.
2404
Instead of altering their training, as every other police department did, and teach the officers not to put their fingers on the trigger until they're prepared to fire, they decided to re-engineer the Glock trigger to add an 8 lb resistance spring to the trigger, effectively giving it a pull weight about the same as the old revolvers (~12 lbs).
2405
Due to the design of the Glock's firing mechanism, using a spring-loaded striker instead of an external hammer, this didn't exactly result in a trigger that had the same feel and function of the old revolvers; it just made the trigger very cumbersome to use, especially for rapid follow-up shots.
2406
What ends up happening is the increased trigger pull weight causes the user to torque their grip on the firearm, resulting in the muzzle waving off the target for rapid follow-up shots.
2407
It has been documented* that NYPD officers have some of the lowest accuracy scores, both in the controlled, low-stress environment of the qualification range, as well as in real-world officer-involved shootings.
2408
This includes an incident where officers fired a total of 73 rounds at a suspect, hitting him a total of two times.
2409
That sort of performance from a police force is unacceptable.
2410
The NYPD are the only police department that use the modified heavy trigger in their Glock pistols.
2411
All other departments worldwide use the standard 5.5lb trigger.
2412
To compare the performance of their officers to another large police force, the LAPD use standard Beretta 92F (US Army designation M9) 9mm pistols, which have triggers that operate in double-action (12 lbs) for the first shot, and single-action (5 lbs) for all follow-up shots.
2413
The LAPD officers have a 51% hit rate.*
2414
The NYPD's modified Glocks operate in double-action for every shot with a 12 lb trigger pull, and their officers have a 15% hit rate.*
2415
* A 15% hit rate is absolutely unacceptable, especially by officers that may have to use their firearms against armed suspects in a crowded city environment, as was the case in this incident.
2416
16 shots were fired, and 9 bystanders were struck.
2417
It's unknown how many shots struck the suspect, or how many struck no-one at all.
2418
Instead of training their officers to be safer users of firearms, the NYPD decided to modify their guns, which resulted in guns that are much less effective, and quite frankly, more dangerous to bystanders than the alternative.
2419
edit: I feel like I need to add this: The officers were 100% justified in shooting this man, as it appears pretty certain the guy pointed a gun on them.
2420
Further, I don't even necessarily blame these officers for shooting 9 innocent bystanders.
2421
For all we know these guys were good shots, but were simply forced to use a shitty weapon.
2422
The blame here should fall on the officers' superiors and any politicians involved in making the rules pertaining to their training and, more importantly, the weapons they use.
2423
As I said elsewhere in this thread, Navy Seals and competition shooters would shoot like shit if they were forced to use 12 lb DAO triggers in a situation where they needed to rapidly shoot their weapon.
2424
It is just an inherently inaccurate function, period.
2425
Like it or not, I believe (read: opinion, not necessarily fact) that along with a desire to cut-corners by not adequately training their police force and/or a refusal to fire those who cannot properly handle a firearm due to heavy police union influence, much of the reasoning behind this policy can be traced back to NYC's rabidly anti-gun culture.
2426
When your entire population is told that guns are inherently bad and unsafe, it is should not be a surprise when policies are shaped around this fear rather than around common sense and logic.
2427
As I said elsewhere, there is a really simple solution to this problem even if they want to maintain a heavy trigger pull on their firearms for safety: using DA/SA hammer-fired guns where the first shot can be made to have a heavy trigger pull for safety, and subsequent shots have a lighter, shorter trigger pull for accuracy.
2428
That said, there are other cities with similar anti-gun cultures, notably DC and Chicago, where their police forces do not use these kind of trigger requirements.
2429
This suddenly makes Stormtroopers seem not-so-bad at their job.
2430
At least we can be happy they were only wounded and not killed.
2431
To be fair, there was one victim that wasn't shot by the police, and that was the guy the shooter killed.
2432
To be fair, it's pretty much impossible to shoot a gun on that corner without hitting a bystander.
2433
I'd be hard pressed to find a busier corner in the country than 34th and 5th at 9am on a weekday.
2434
Does New York hire former stormtroopers from the galatic empire?
2435
So, if a gunman is running around killing people in NYC, you're 9 times more likely to be shot by a cop.
2436
Edit: Does nobody remember the rule "Don't feed the trolls?"
2437
i smell lawsuits and a $100 million settlement
2438
Authorities said an investigation is under way after one officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven.
2439
Three victims suffered gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments.
2440
Bullet fragments are still gunshot wounds.
2441
Bloomberg likes the wrong kind of gun control,apparently.
2442
If an uninsured American bystander is shot by a police officer, who pays the medical bill?
2443
"My bad"
2444
I'm a Marine and a combat veteran, and I would never have discharged a weapon into a crowd of people to shoot one guy, even in Afghanistan, let alone into a crowd of my fellow countrymen.
2445
Absolutely despicable.
2446
This just confirms what every civilian shooting enthusiast already knows; police officers are not held to adequate standards of marksmanship and shooting under duress.

Check out the new tactical gear designed specifically for the NYPD.
2451
So we should take away the guns away from the police if they can't handle them responsibly.
2452
May want to hit the range fellas.

NYP: To serve and protect you to death.
2455
Lots of talk about trigger pressure and crap, have you guys ever seen an nypd officer?
2456
If you look at them sideways they threaten and curse at you.
2457
These guys are trigger happy, I've witnessed cops say to people "I should shoot you here".
2458
There is no reason to fire so many bullets on one person.
2459
Further example, they fired 12 bullets at a man with a butcher knife over 5 yards away from them.
2460
When they say it is not safe in nyc, they mean the police not the criminals.
2461
So that whole thing about "If everybody had a gun, these shootings wouldn't happen," probably not the case.
2462
Several of my relatives are NYPD officers.
2463
Two are sergeants.
2464
One is a S.W.A.T. team leader in Manhattan.
2465
One is a lieutenant in Manhattan.
2466
One is the driver of a Brooklyn Inspector.
2467
Let me tell you something about the crack marksmanship of the average NYPD officer: it's a joke.
2468
One of my relatives, who is currently scamming a permanent "out on three-quarters" status after being lightly wounded in the line of duty (very slightly and non-permanently injured in a non-serious incident) joked often about the once-a-year qualification at the shooting range that all officers are required to pass.
2469
She and her buddies would call the range master and ask what he wanted for lunch.
2470
They would then procure said meal and show up at a time when the range was not busy.
2471
Everyone ate, drank and was merry for an hour or so at the shooting range in Brooklyn.
2472
Without so much as drawing a weapon, everyone passed qualification with flying colors.
2473
They all joked about how the average once-a-year deer hunter was probably a better shot than the the average "hairbag" (veteran police officer).
2474
If I worked in a profession that featured the real possibility that my life would depend upon my skill with a firearm, I would practice night and day in order to be the most lethal marksman on the fuckin' planet.
2475
On all possible planets.
2476
If I were one of those clowns in uniform shooting at a fashion designer who was aiming at me, I would have killed him twice because I would make damn sure I had the skill to put a bullet where I wanted it to go.
2477
There is no fatter, slower, drunker, more complacent police department in the world than the NYPD.
2478
There is no more arrogant or corrupt agency in the world.
2479
The LAPD of the 1970's has nothing on them.
2480
EIGHT wounded civilians!
2481
What an embarrassment!
2482
I hope they get sued individually and as a department.
2483
How lucky they were that they did not kill an innocent by-stander or several.
2484
Here is a word from the inside: the NYPD is the embodiment of all the derogatory things you hear about them.
2485
They are inept, corrupt, racist haters of the general public they swear to serve and protect.
2486
Sixteen shots fired.
2487
The suspect was hit ten times, and nine bystanders were hit.
2488
19 wounds, sixteen shots fired.
2489
Maybe I just don't math well, but holy fucknuts, NYPD.
2490
time to go to the range.
2491
Wow this pisses me off.
2492
A few weeks ago someone posted a video where NYPD unload on a guy with a knife and when I said it was unsafe I got downvoted to shit because people said they were "trained" to avoid collateral damage.
2493
Fuck reddit.
2494
Except that first guy.
2495
NYC PD need to work on their accuracy.
2496
If it took a dozen bullets to subdue the gunman, they are really lousy shots.
2497
Shots that miss can ricochet and fragment.
2498
That endangers people and can cause property damage.
2499
However, I think we shouldn't be blaming the police officers here.
2500
Their use of force was entirely justified.
2501
The gunman was a threat to the public and immediately threatened police officers.
2502
However, I think we should focus on their training and weapons.
2503
They hire morons to fill in the ranks and follow orders.
2504
Rule #4 of handling a firearm(paraphrased): be aware of your target and what is around the target.
2505
They broke that rule.
2506
Yep, and us crazy license holding wackos are dangerous.
2507
I believe that anyone who unloads nine shots or seven shots without checking where the rounds are going is dangerous.
2508
Perhaps it is time to rethink gun control, and only allow the citizens to be armed?
2509
We tend to shoot far less people than the police do.
2510
This is a simple truth: My grandmother was a better shot.
2511
Let's put this in context.
2512
A construction worker saw the gunman shoot his target before chasing him through the city and calling the police.
2513
While running, he passed by two police officers who he motioned to about the fact the guy had a gun.
2514
They went to talk to him, and he pulled a pistol on them.
2515
If it were me, I'd shit my pants and start crying.
2516
Not actually, but seriously, they probably tried to unholster faster than they ever have before.
2517
I'm not saying it's fine they shot nine people, but seriously, the gunman could have caused a lot more shit had they not just pulled the trigger.
2518
Not really a surprise: this guy was treated like shit by a dick of a boss at work and then was fired.
2519
In most workplace shootings, the shooters are pretty careful about going after the boss and any rats that supported the boss.
2520
So the guy went to work, spotted the bully that made his life miserable, and opened fire on him.
2521
Then he just walked away.
2522
Then, the infamously trigger-happy NYPD showed up and shot everyone in sight.
2523
ACAB.
2524
What do they shoot like fucking stormtroopers or something!
2525
I have rare insight here: I am a high-school senior and I have a lot of acting experience.
2526
Because of this and a very good record with my administration, my school's Campus Officer iinvited me to participate in a police training as a shooter/bystander.
2527
We used live tag rounds, like paintballs but they fit in normal guns.
2528
(And hurt a helluva lot more) Anyway, when I was the shooter, the five officers hit me three times, the wall ten, and civilians (other actors) two.
2529
They were learning when not to shoot, as no one is a perfect shot and you have to be able to hit your target if you're going to pull the trigger.
2530
They were trainees, but.
2531
honestly they were shit in a gunfight.
2532
When cops show up to a scene and cause the same, if not more damage than the actual perp, something is obviously amiss and the purpose of the cops in the first place should be called into question.
2533
What are we safe from and who are we helped by if we cannot depend on cops to put the safety of the public before their own overly inflated, patriotic notion of personal threat and public security?
2534
People were heard screaming, "please stop helping us"
2535
Remember guys, only the police are allowed to endanger people's lives.
2536
All empire state building shooting victims were wounded by police .except the guy that the shooter killed.
2537
Or are we just ignoring that because we want to focus on how we don't like cops.
2538
did they have to cut out the gun range in their budget cuts?
2539
So NYPD shot more people than the perp who they where responding too.
2540
Hey guys, we need to discuss gun contr- NO.
2541
Facist pigs!
2542
Take away their gu- NO.
2543
They shouldn't hav- NO.
2544
The only thing that we should gleam from this incident is that we need to improve the firearm training of the NYPD.
2545
The only thing that went wrong here is that they weren't as accurate as they should be.
2546
The title is in error.
2547
critically.
2548
The armed man shot and killed his victim.
2549
That is significant.
2550
The police just fucked up everyone else.
2551
Criminals don't injure innocent people with guns during a shootout, law appointed officials with abysmal aim do.
2552
If speed has taught me anything it's to shoot the hostage.
2553
II.
2554
Never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.III.
2555
Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.
2556
IV.
2557
Keep your weapon on safe until you are ready to fire.
2558
It's not just that.
2559
After columbine a lot of departments began training under a "shoot first" set of rules of engagement.
2560
NYPD are the folks that took this to the most extreme extent.
2561
Then 9/11 comes along and they have been trained that basically all threats are jihadist bombers just about to talk down a skyscraper.
2562
It is impossible for them to have a proportional or rational response.
2563
Bloomberg and kelly have to go before anything can begin to change.
2564
They are some of the most out of touch and irresponsible leaders the city has ever had.
2565
The overall price tag for it's anti-occupy operations was north of 30 million dollars and anyone identified in that continues to be followed, surveilled and harassed almost 24/7.
2566
I find it ironic that Bloomberg's employees are responsible for a mass shooting.
2567
Question: will the victims be eligible for compensation?
2568
Trigger happy and way too much testosterone.
2569
Cops can't wait to use their guns.
2570
I'd like to say I'm surprised at the incompetence, but I'm not surprised.
2571
Watch the video.
2572
The cop on the right shoots the guy with one hand, a no-no.
2573
they really need to stop training them to close their eyes before shooting
2574
As someone that doesn't live in the US, a week doesn't go by that I don't see a news story about being people shot in tragic circumstances.
2575
I really hope for the US citizens that one day you will approach the problem of your gun culture.
2576
What are they fucking storm troopers?
2577
Edit: grammar and shit.
2578
unfortunately for democracy, the majority of americans have no power and the wealthy have lots of power, and thats why you see the exactly the opposite happening.
2579
Yep, and when given the opportunity to take by force the labor of someone else's life for your personal gain without your personal effort, many folks believe that it is OK to do.
2580
Until such time as YOU have enough to be attractive to the masses.
2581
that is why he can not be trusted to be president
2582
Shocker.
2583
what about cuts on military?
2584
Hell, I'd happily want higher taxes on ME before I want those cuts.I see taxes as a 'membership fee' which I'd love to go towards getting our infrastructure out of the 19th century, quality education and accessible state higher education, better public health initiatives, consumer protection services, to have just a fraction of the huge subsidies we give to big coal and oil to go instead to alternative energy research, etc.
2585
What ever happened to the idea of a public commons?
2586
And, yet, a large percentage of the voters who feel this way will still vote for the candidate who publicly and proudly promises to do just that -- because . . .
2587
socialism, man.
2588
Corporate profits and the GDP are at an all time high, while workers' wages at a percent of GDP are at an all time low.
2589
If they are not willing to reinvest in the economy in the form of fair compensation then they'll have to do it through taxes.
2590
The reason that social security and medicare are threatened with insolvency is because the government borrowed from those funds in order to make up for deficits elsewhere.
2591
Taxes were cut, wars were started, social safety net trust funds were looted to pay for it.
2592
What seems like the right thing to do? Cut the benefits that people have already paid for out of their own income, or raise taxes back to where they should have stayed in the first place?
2593
EDIT: condensation -; compensation, DYAC
2594
That's not the problem.
2595
The issue is how many are willing to see their taxes go up to prevent those cuts?
2596
Taxing the rich isn't going to solve the problem by itself.
2597
Well, NO SHIT!
2598
Why does it always have to be higher taxes on the wealthy?
2599
Why not just ask them "Would you rather have the same services and higher taxes or reduced services with the same taxes?"
2600
Turning us against them is bullshit.
2601
fact of the matter is that america is the ONLY place where socialism is implemented upside down if you are wealthy you pay low taxes, you get all sorts of government benefits (almost every industry is subsidised, farmers etc) only when it comes to the working ppl that actually CREATE all the wealth its a bad thing, if they get a slice of the cake as a european watching and following american politics i have to wonder if you are really that narrowminded - not to say stupid - that you dont see what has happened?
2602
since the early 80s the income of the middle class has shrunk to about 45% of all income going to the middle class upwards mobility has flipped, it is more likely that children will be worse off than their parents (unprecidented in high developed countries) money is an abstract value, work is not, because it actually creates goods.
2603
if one day everyone decided not to work anymore, how much would money be worth?
2604
i bet that after a week ppl would trade in all their possesions for a warm meal and clean water are you so delusional that you are able to call yourself the nation of the free while you are nr1 in prisoners per capita?
2605
yes you are number one when it comes to locking up your own ppl.
2606
right up there ahead of russia and belarus (which is a dictatorship) you have been royaly fucked by wallstreet and voodoo-economics and yet you think this is the best system out there?:D you believe in austrian economics?
2607
as an austrian i can tell you it's bullshit.
2608
it does only work if all market players obey by the same rules, have the same morals and there is no playing favorites by the government, if you think that in the US that is the case go ahead you will be fine but if not you will get fucked again and again and again until the mood boils over and you experience a revolution of the likes of early 20th century russia.
2609
So, a majority of people would rather have other people pay money so they can continue to use services without paying more themselves.no
2610
surprise there.
2611
Because, you know, you wouldn't want to cut the 95% of the budget that is waste, corporate welfare, and fraud.
2612
Go straight for "food safety".
2613
Excellent.
2614
We don't have food safety or border security now.
2615
Never mind the false dichotomy.
2616
There are things we could cut that would save money, improve our international image AND not Kill people.
2617
I don't understand why anybody would rather cut public services rather than tax the wealthy.there's
2618
no logic in this quote.
2619
"Hmm would I rather lose services that keep me safe or would I rather some wealthy guy get taxed.?"
2620
I'd rather see cuts made to pensions and salaries for public servants, and a reduction in war spending.
2621
Let's start with that before we talk about more taxes or cutting services to the poor.
2622
Border "security" - hahahahaaha
2623
My first thought at reading that line is, "No shit.
2624
because the majority of Americans are not the wealthy."
2625
Totally, cut military spending and make the military account for the monies they receive.
2626
Our debt, we need to pay down our debt.
2627
Rich people need to help.
2628
How is it that in a down economy rich people still get richer while the majority of the rest of us get poorer?
2629
If things were fair, rich people would get poorer at the same rate, as a percentage, as poor people.
2630
Romney doesn't want to show his tax returns because he has used every trick in the book to avoid supporting the country he wants to be President of.
2631
What a fucking dick.
2632
Then bring the issue up with your rep and VOTE.
2633
Talking is easy.
2634
How many people have every contacted their local rep?
2635
How many people have ask where their rep stood on issues that are important to them?
2636
Not many.
2637
Fewer public services before higher taxes on the wealthy said no one ever.
2638
As a state employee (and teacher) I know how frustrating it is when we are asked to give, especially since the fed/state employees that get whacked are not the ones who are the biggest money sinks.
2639
You guys, cutting taxes on the wealthy is only going to disincentivize them from investing in more capital and creating more jobs.
2640
These social programs you speak of like food safety and free healthcare are just socialist schemes to destroy the middle class and end the free market as we know it.
2641
*This message is Sponsored by the Mitt Romney Campaign
2642
the irony of American politics is that nearly every one of them believes in higher taxes on the wealthy if it means maintaining or increasing public services like food safety, border security, infrastructure, and education.
2643
that is, nearly every American endorses socialism by any other name.
2644
socialism is a toxic word, but in principle, Americans fucking love it, especially if its at the expense of future generations.
2645
the "greatest generation" was thrilled to push the costs of their economy, pensions, security, and achievements on their grandchildren.
2646
As long as its not me!
2647
Just another example of why we Americans are too stupid to be in charge of our own selves.
2648
I'd rather see the government stop wasting money.
2649
because if it can get more money out of rich people.
2650
it will get more money out of you.
2651
So most people want stuff paid for by other people?

2654
I'll settle for either one if either one would actually balance the dam budget but since nether will.
2655
What's the point
2656
i can't see why.
2657
I've always wanted a teacher to ask this.
2658
Make them all be friends, make them introduce each other, a simple hand shake and a name.
2659
Let me be nice to each other for 3 seconds.
2660
Tell them its okay to be friendly.
2661
A hello will suffice over anything else, they should act like grown ups, not children.
2662
Yet, quite a few of them still want to vote for Romney.?
2663
Isn't this obvious?
2664
Sorry, but if that were actually true they wouldn't be voting morons into congress.
2665
You can't not vote, or vote for idiots and then complain that shit doesn't go your way.
2666
The American people are just as responsible as anyone else.
2667
This is all well and good, but the median voter won't act on that sentiment; they'll be swayed by wedge issues and other irrelevancies.
2668
They should make cuts to public services and tax the wealthy
2669
Well of course they would, the majority aren't wealthy
2670
This just in: Grass still green.
2671
America is the land of opportunity, and the right to be successful with no limits completely on your own.
2672
Unless of course, you get "too" successful and become wealthy.
2673
That is NOT how this country should operate.
2674
Good for Americans
2675
This just in: No shit
2676
God, this is such a fucking awful argument.
2677
It's the prototypical argument made my politicians designed to elicit fear.
2678
Food safety and border security doesn't need to be affected by any cuts.
2679
The solution is simple - make education reforms that punish ineffective teachers and ban students who under perform from advancing to the next grade, ban all welfare for recipients without social security numbers, end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, cut all foreign aid with the exception of direct democratic allies such as Israel and relief aid for natural disasters, legalize marijuana, LSD and peyote, and tax the living fuck out of it, set a flat tax rate of 9% for all citizens, and allow on-shore/off-shore drilling permits to begin.
2680
Voila.
2681
Fixed the fucking country.
2682
You're welcome, everyone.
2683
Well fuck the majority of Americans.
2684
They should have been born rich.
2685
Says the Washington Post.
2686
Might as well check Fox's stance on the issue.
2687
I can assure you, the "poll" would turn out quite differently.
2688
Well to be fair.
2689
a majority of Americans are not part of the "wealthy", so this is logical/common sense really.
2690
Why am I not surprised that the majority of Americans want higher taxes on the wealthy?
2691
Oh! Maybe it's because the majority of Americans aren't "the wealthy".
2692
Did anyone else find this pretty pointless?
2693
The whole premise of the survey is flawed.
2694
Is it so surprising that the majority of people would rather raise taxes on the minority (top ~5%) than cut spending on programs?
2695
On one side it effects them in no way and the other it takes things away from them.
2696
HUGE shocker on the outcome.
2697
I am not saying that the wealthy are not underpaying taxes just that the survey is complete crap.
2698
Haha, you think this is a surprise?
2699
Guess why we don't have a democracy?
2700
Do you think we could honestly have capitalism in a democracy?
2701
You don't get a vote in these kinds of decisions unless you can get voted into congress.
2702
Sorry people want free shit?
2703
Who knew?
2704
The title is hardly surprising since the majority of Americans are not wealthy and would not be affected by a tax increase on the wealthy.
2705
You don't say?
2706
Interesting, but why should I give a shit what the majority of Americans want?
2707
duh. all this says is people think "i'd rather not pay more and get more than pay more and get less."
2708
So basically what you're saying is that a majority of Americans are not completely retarded?
2709
"It appears Americans have some fascination with not having E.Coli and Bird Flu outbreaks from their food.
2710
Instead they have this crazy idea that the wealthy should start paying taxes!"
2711
In other breaking news, people would like to keep having clean water to drink.
2712
Reporting for the Washington Post, I am Captain Obvious.
2713
Seriously wouldn't thIs be like a no brainier?
2714
Too bad this isn't a democracy.
2715
ooooh.
2716
imagine that! the vast matagjority are poor and want keep taking from the rich
2717
It doesn't matter what a majority of Americans want.
2718
That money does not belong to them and they don't have the right to decide what someone does with it.
2719
Seriously, what the fuck do you stupid teenage Redditors not understand about this?
2720
But what they don't understand is that it's not an either/or proposition.
2721
Raising taxes on the wealthy won't raise nearly enough revenue to avoid cuts in social services.
2722
But since the Democrats haven't effectively framed the debate this way, and have so far failed to energize the base, so it may not matter.
2723
Fivethirtyeight.com
2724
has seen a significant difference in projected voter turnout between republicans and democrats.
2725
That has made the difference before, and it may do so again.
2726
Yet people still fail to understand how group efforts work and say things "but my vote doesn't matter".
2727
Well sure, except when it does.
2728
Categorical imperative and all that.
2729
We'll see how this plays out, but I'm not counting out Romney yet.
2730
It doesn't matter what we want.
2731
Washington doesn't give a shit.
2732
The people who sit in the house and senate only care about what makes them money and gives them power.
2733
Everything else can go hang.
2734
The majority of Americans are very generous with other people's money.
2735
Amadeus.
2736
It won eight Oscars.
2737
Probably because both programs provide benefits that far outweigh their costs.
2738
The Food Safety and Inspection Service, under the Department of Agriculture, cost 1.014
2739
Billion dollars in FY2012(Source on page64).
2740
U.S. Customs and Border Protection spent $10,371,596,000.
2741
Total.
2742
That's a grand total of 11.5 billion dollars in a 3.796 trillion dollar total.
2743
That's approximately .3% of the budget!
2744
Good post!
2745
Why don't we have both?
2746
A majority of wealthy people say fuck poor people, leave our money alone.
2747
Just sayin.
2748
wealthy republicans don't want to pay a dime to help others with healthcare or anything else.
2749
they just want to enjoy being rich.
2750
who the fuck doesnt want higher taxes on the rich except the rich?
2751
who is cominup with this shit and what happened to the general intelligence of your average us citizen?
2752
Since when has America been majority ruled?
2753
writers have to be careful about touting the "majority of americans" angle when trying to make a point when constitutional issues may also come into play.
2754
A majority of Americans may be also against gay marriage or have wanted wire taps on middle eastern families after 9/11.
2755
Doesn't mean its right.
2756
Don't tell me why the majority of Americans want higher taxes for the wealthy - I'm sure they do - its not surprising.
2757
Tell me why the wealthy have not been paying their fair share.
2758
that assumes that raising taxes on the rich would fix our financial issues.
2759
It won't.
2760
As an American, I can say that I enjoy food and the benefits it gives me.
2761
If i never hear what the "Majority of Americans Want" again, it will be too soon.
2762
Fuck polls, they aren't news.
2763
Is that because the majority of Americans aren't "the wealthy"?
2764
So imposing this higher tax on the wealthy would have no effect on "the majority" of Americans.
2765
Do you guys not understand that simply taxing "the rich" gets rid of jobs?
2766
Do you know who the people are that make ;$250,000 per year?
2767
They're smallBusiness owners.
2768
When a company has to pay higher taxes, they're going to have to lay somebody off to compensate.
2769
Did you know that the small businesses of the United States employ about 70% of the United States work force?
2770
Higher taxes= higher unemployment.
2771
Blatantly taxing "the rich" will just make things worse.
2772
As unfair as it sounds, lowering taxes on "the rich" will create jobs.
2773
And go ahead and downvote me, Democrats, for not agreeing with you.
2774
All I'm asking you to do is hear what I am saying.
2775
I'm neither democrat not republican, and frankly I dislike both Obama and Romney, but Obama has had plenty of time in office.
2776
He's doubled the deficit, unemployment is at 8.3%, and inflation is at about 6% or 7%.
2777
You realize this survey essentially says that a majority of Americans are comfortable spending other people's money.
2778
Too bad what the majority want.
2779
the ruling party wants you to pay more, them less.
2780
You must be talking about a democracy.
2781
Not a majority of wealthy Americans.
2782
The Ultimate Mitt Romney Flip-Flop Collection Multiple choice Mitt! LOL!

Shitty Headlin : When Romney was governor of Liberal Mass.
2784
True Headline : When Liberal Romney was governor of Mass.
2785
But why does it only work for 20-30 minutes?
2786
Why not just keep injecting them with more?
2787
Joke going around on reddit: A conservative, a liberal, and a moderate walk into a bar.
2788
The bartender says "Hi Mitt".
2789
See, I had a vision the other day of an awesome series of "attack" ads on Romney.
2790
What I wish I could do (you know, if I had a few million dollars for ad buys) is go through the archives and find Romney speeches where he's speaking about things that are 180 degrees removed from his current position.
2791
Preferrably things that would horrify the GOP to hear him say.
2792
I would take a large chunk from these speeches, like 30-45 seconds totally unedited and uninterrupted of Mitt, say, talking about how awesome government healthcare is and how mandatory buy-ins are great.
2793
I'd run that as the ad, with the date, time, and venue VERY clearly marked at the bottom of the screen with text big enough to be readable on pretty much any TV.
2794
(IE, so no one could attempt to claim I was misrepresenting the context.)
2795
And then.
2796
That's it.
2797
NO other messaging whatsoever aside from whatever the mandatory minimum PAC identification is.
2798
(And I'd give the PAC a totally vague, nonpolitical, and slightly highbrow name like "Citizens for Honesty in Discourse" or something like that.)
2799
It would literally be nothing but a totally uninterrupted, unedited clip of Romney saying things that completely undercut his current positions.
2800
Preferably, there would be a lot of them as well since, well, he's got a lot of these old speeches out there.
2801
If I had the money, I'd try to run them so they appeared at least as often as any of Romney's own ads.
2802
He would have no way of responding to this, and the more you ran them, the more you'd cause little worms of doubt to burrow into the heads of the GOP faithful.
2803
It would probably also cause some confusion among those who don't know what his policies are anyway.
2804
It would be cheap, dirty, 100% truthful, and virtually impossible for him to defend against because the lack of any other messaging means that there would be virtually nothing there for Romney to use to try to talk his way out of it.
2805
Unless he wanted to go for some incredible whopper and try to claim the videos were doctored - which they wouldn't be in any way - any attempt to debunk them at all would automatically validate them in the process.
2806
Let's see Mr. Windsock talk his way outta that one.
2807
I'm sure, back then, he also supported public servants releasing their tax returns.
2808
If I were labeling this with a quote, I have to say I would personally have chosen this instead: “The Romney Programme for Economic Recovery, Growth and Jobs? is like “Fifty Shades of Grey? without the sex I love The Economist.
2809
MAYBE HE'S REALLY A GOOD GUY.Or maybe he'll say anything to have power.
2810
And to think, he could have just been honest and said, "I wish to represent the positions of my electorate; the Republicans who would have me as President, even those I do not personally agree with.
2811
I did so as Governor and I feel that it is necessary for politicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to serve as representatives of the public's will."
2812
But then he'd never have made the Republican nomination.
2813
do you really think someone would do that?
2814
just go into politics and lie?
2815
Its funny what money will do to a person.
2816
He's now a full fledged piece of shit.
2817
Its all about the campaign contributions
2818
Not to derail this too much, but requiring everyone buy health insurance isn't really all that liberal of a position.
2819
It's the liberal position now, but the idea came from the Heritage Foundation if I recall correctly.
2820
The Heritage Foundation isn't exactly a 'liberal' think-tank.
2821
The fact that the Heritage Foundation's health insurance plan is now a default position for 'liberals' shows you how far to the right American politics have moved over the past four decades.
2822
First, liberals favored a Canadian style single payer system (Truman), then supported universal insurance for the elderly and the poor only (Johnson), then supported an employer mandate to provide insurance (this was originally Nixon, but came to be supported by Clinton, i.e. this was 'Hillarycare') and now the Democratic Party has to defend the most liberal plan it could get through, which is the Heritage Foundation's libertarian scheme of mandated coverage and through a general subsidization of insurance companies.
2823
Another good example of how far to the right American politics has moved is Cap and Trade.
2824
Cap and Trade was originally envisioned as a market-friendly, conservative solution to addressing pollution; C&T was developed and implemented by the Bush administration in the 1990s to deal with acid rain.
2825
The default Democratic position in those days was to regulate polluters.
2826
Now the default Democratic position has become to accommodate them by rigging energy markets and allowing polluters to make a profit off of the whole thing.
2827
tl;dr - The only reason Mitt would be considered 'liberal' for supporting a requirement to buy health insurance is because American politics has moved so far to the right that being forced to buy health insurance from the insurance industry is now a liberal position, despite having originated on the libertarian right.
2828
It's interesting that they beat Kerry to a pulp for being a "flip-flopper" while it's hardly spoken of in regard to Romney.
2829
But then again, little of what Romney says makes sense, as evidenced by this completely non-satirical youtube soundbite clip.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L9A1IMTQo
2830
That's why he's called Governor Etch-a-sketch.
2831
As a Massachusetts resident, I can confirm he changed his view on health care because he watched it bankrupt our Commonwealth.
2832
I think it's part of a bid to do whatever is necessary to get a mormon in the white house.
2833
When Obama was running for state senate and throughout most of his political career, he opposed gay marriage.
2834
When he was running for US Senate, he opposed military intervention in Libya without congressional authorization.
2835
He also promised to spend billions on NASA to "make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on Earth."
2836
He promised to not stand by as genocide continued in Darfur, much to the delight of college liberals everywhere.
2837
When he was running for president, he supported closing Gitmo, which he called a symbol of all that was wrong with the War on Terror.
2838
As a first-term president, he stood up to Russia and supported Bush-era plans for Third Site missile defences in Poland and the Czech Republic.
2839
He also repeatedly opposed de facto amnesty for young illegals via executive order, claiming it was unconstitutional and not within the power of the executive.
2840
Now, as November 2012 approaches, all those positions are completely reversed.
2841
Abandoned, also, are his promises of reducing unemployment to under 8 percent once the stimulus passed, and his plan to cut the deficit in half, and his plans to help solar companies like Solydnra (run conveniently by his cronies.)
2842
All those promises ("I'll be a one-term president" if I don't fix the economy) are now.ongoing
2843
"goals."
2844
But this is reddit, and you are all liberals, so we can only pick on Republicans, right?
2845
Romney is a big evil corporate liar who must be an alien, and Obama never tells a lie, right?
2846
Romney can't change on abortion in 20 years without you people making hooker jokes, but Obama can change on Gitmo and gay marriage in a month?
2847
Pathetic, but interesting at the same time.
2848
Politicians respond to the electorate.
2849
That's in their nature, Democrat or Republican, Romney or Obama.
2850
Get used to it, and stop pretending your side is immune.
2851
Two more reversals on his punch card and he makes the Pandering Championships! USA! USA! USA!
2852
Yet it doesn't matter because their new 'base' will vote for him just to get that brown guy out of their White House.
2853
ugh this is so r/politics.
2854
sure, lets jump on the little things like changing your mind on every major issue, but not a peep when obama says he'll end an unjust war one month then ends it another month.
2855
well one of those four is a change for the better.
2856
gun control is largely ineffective.
2857
Thats beside the point though.
2858
Mitt Romney is a man with no personal beliefs or conviction beyond saying whatever will get him elected.
2859
I disagree with Obama on many things, most being how he has failed to uphold many of his promises but he doesnt flip flop like Romney.
2860
Not only that but Romney is a man without morals.
2861
Romney is such a joke that it seems that the republicans are just throwing the election.
2862
I'm going to ignore the issues surrounding the guys funding sources, his history as a businessman or governor, and everything else said about Mitt outside of the OP's title.
2863
Isn't that the point of a democratic (I don't mean the title as dem vs. rep) leader?
2864
To sense the desires of an electorate and pander to them?
2865
To not lead, but to bring forward the desires of the electorate?
2866
I realize I am taking an incredible simplistic view and focusing on only a singular statement, but I find it interesting to follow a simple concept sometimes.
2867
I would assert that it is the duty of appointees to try to look above the whimsical desires of an electorate and apply wisdom to policy while it is the duty of the elected to find appeal and deliver on their promises.
2868
It appears to me that the STATED ideal of an elected official is to be a sycophant windsock expert in the ways of parliament to bring about the desires of the people, only tempered by the wisdom of appointees and the senate who's duty is to look at the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of an electorates fickle desires.
2869
Windsock Romney certainly doesn't have the appeal of forging ahead LEADER Romney, but I wonder if the electorate would be better appeased by a nimble administrator seeking to serve than a stout leader looking to drive.
2870
I live in Massachusetts and seriously fuck Mitt Romney.
2871
He treated our state like a business.
2872
While he did manage to reduce our deficit, it came at the cost of the little guy.
2873
He cut higher education and raised fees for everything you can think of including the retail fees on gasoline which meant many retailers started gouging us for gas.
2874
I know of two shell stations in my city that were forced to reduce their prices because the gov't found out they were trying to profit off the increase and he cut state aid to the cities and towns that needed it for development and job creation.
2875
The infrastructure of almost every town I went through was pitifully under maintained due to cutbacks and many towns never got plowed out during snowstorms.
2876
We now also have mandated health insurance which a lot of people cannot afford and it forced some small businesses to insure their employees which caused many to close their doors shortly after.
2877
Now I have to pay for insurance I don't use, ever, or face large penalties on my tax returns.
2878
The plot thickens.
2879
he represents the views of his constitutes.
2880
this is what representation is all about.
2881
people expect politicians to live by a strict philosophy that they actually believe in (which i'm guilty of doing too), but the reality is they're elected officials that are supposed to represent the people.
2882
the reality is, mitt is doing what a politician is supposed to do.
2883
it's just unfortunate that the country is full of ignorant and stubborn voters that steer him in the wrong direction.
2884
You don't want to know what Obama thought when he was a senator and before.
2885
Do you really think that he would of had a chance at getting elected in Massachusetts if he wasn't pro all of those things?
2886
Not supporting him, just making a statement It does make him look like an extremely weak candidate though.
2887
At least he is solid on the hating gays issue.
2888
Posted this a little while ago -- http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yhao5/cananydemocratsoutthereimaginevotingfora/
2889
And when Romney flip-flops in office, we're going to dump his ass the same way we're dumping Obama in November.
2890
The only reason for the contradiction is because the republican party is more right than the nation as a whole is, and arguably moving even more to the right.
2891
So, if he wanted the nomination he had to oppose all of those otherwise we would be stuck with Rick Santorum as the republican candidate.
2892
In all likely hood if he wins the election he will move towards the middle where he is more comfortable and more align with.
2893
And you know who we have to blame for this?
2894
First past the post voting rules!
2895
Yeah that is who.
2896
Remember when Obama was against gay marriage and no one gave a shit?
2897
At public Romney events, citizens need to start asking Mitt how many more Ann Keenans he wants.
2898
He believes in family, money, and the freaky-ass Mormon cult (which may account for the other two).
2899
Other than that, he has no beliefs or views of his own.
2900
Lucky for him, there are a lot of hicks that will vote for anybody the conservative media scares them into voting for.
2901
Etch -a-sketch
2902
That's because Romney an Obama are both statists, big government overspending addicts.
2903
Their biggest campaign contributors are also similar.
2904
Ummm.didn't Obama switch stances on multiple issues as well?
2905
I know for a fact he switched his stance on Gay Marriage, but I'm pretty sure he also pulled a two-face on the Patriot Act, Wall Street Bailouts, and Guantanamo.
2906
I don't think he did.
2907
Governors simply sign legislation, as presidents do.
2908
The legislature in MA is overwhelmingly Democratic (or they have a dem majority and no filibuster)
2909
does it really matter about Mitt's personal conviction?
2910
As long as he governs on the platform he campaigns he is being a good representative.
2911
So how many times can "politician flip flops" be repackaged?
2912
Also, I'm amazed people give a shit anymore.
2913
The system is done.
2914
He supports those things at a state level.
2915
Not a federal.
2916
States exist.
2917
Well, they used to.
2918
Until Jefferson Davis lost.
2919
Maybe because governing a state is different than running a country?
2920
Honestly, can none of you see how you can support mandating things in Massachusetts and not support mandating them federally?
2921
The awkward moment when the guy running for president has no idea what he believes in.
2922
Shouldn't a guy who's hoping to be in charge of a nation be a little bit more put together?
2923
I've got this weird idea in the back of my mind that this is all one big troll and Romney, if he does win, is going to revert back to more sensible positions.
2924
Wouldn't that be fun
2925
So you're angry because he worked with the people of his state and made compromises based on what they wanted?
2926
Anyone who can't see that this entire "republican" vs "democrat" thing is just a charade should shoot themselves.
2927
Vote third party.
2928
As a TRUE conservative, this is why I have never, and will never, be behind Romney.
2929
This election is NOT conservative-friendly at all.
2930
Maybe neo-cons, but they suck monkey balls.
2931
Can't wait for 2016 and Rand Paul's potential run.
2932
When Obama was senator for liberal Ohio he opposed the war in Afghanistan, Guantanamo, supported Gun control and voter registration.
2933
Now he feels the opposite.
2934
See how that works?
2935
hes only doing what to people want.
2936
He is bending over backwards and taking it in the ass just so the people can have what they want.
2937
What should be Mitt Romney's official theme song
2938
Anyone in office will say anything and do anything to stay in office.
2939
I can see the point you are trying to make, but isn't Obama finally supporting gay marriage this election season after being against it for so long the same kind of thing?
2940

2941
Welcome to politics.

I honestly don't think Mitt Romney has a political party.
2943
I think he just does whatever he sees necessary at the moment.
2944
He will just go with whatever will give him the most success.
2945
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw him in the preliminaries for DEMOCRATS in 2016.
2946
so when in power, you know he'll most likely work for those then with the most cash.
2947
Let's call him by his Christian nameit's Willard.
2948
That should get more conversations going followed by the funny jokes after.
2949
And despite this obvious flaw, how is he so popular?
2950
Like Larry the Cable Guy, Americans continue to mystify me.
2951
He's a fake!
2952
And he has shifty NixonEyes!
2953
We get it, he shouldn't have been the party nominee, also its so surprising seeing a politician turn out to be a hypocrite.
2954
Bitch, he's chasing that paypa!
2955
What? So. he went from a left wing liberal to a right wing conservative?
2956
Is this some kind of elaborate political joke?
2957
Savin'
2958
Why are people surprised that a white middle aged filthy rich corporate-minded individual is such a flip-flop?
2959
What a surprise, politicians are using civil liberty issues to get people to vote for them.
2960
There is only thing Mitt Romney believes in- becoming a president.
2961
what death by lion?
2962
By the way the layout on that site sucks on mobile.
2963
This is something I've actually noticed about myself as of late.
2964
I would enjoy reading any followup studies if there are any.
2965
When pre-menstrual symptoms occur.any

"If by Whiskey" comes to mind in reading this article.
2968
Even ants are surveiled these days.
2969
This is extremely outdated news.
2970
We've been able to predict hair and eye color pretty accurately for years.
2971
I think Ive read from somewhere that quantum mechanics predicted electrons travelling back in time and they ended up being positrons.
2972
So they might be on to something.
2973
Edit: this was the book: Brian Cox & Jeff Forshaw The quantum universe: Everything that happen does happen
2974
When I worked at Zilog, one of the other process engineers I worked with there, a kinda quirky guy, would talk about 'darkons', something that would be the opposite of photons, and were mathematically valid.
2975
Spooky.
2976
So, basically, they are making vitreous metals or metallic glass?
2977
Can someone make this as a visualizer?
2978
pretty much better than watching the iTunes channel.
2979
I need me a squid.
2980
check it out at 2:15.
2981
DAAAAAAMMNN!
2982
Aaaand if you are german you can't watch this.
2983
When will they get the proxy method working again?
2984
Squid membranes.
2985
I see what they did there
2986
Great.
2987
So the next must-have clubbing accessory is going to be squid fins.
2988
Why did I assume a squid's fin was a euphemism for scrotal skin?
2989
Science win! Coolest thing i've seen in a long time!
2990
Since I know reddit lots of stuff just make me go "meh" these days ^ Thanks for making me smile and say that's fkin awesome out loud OP!
2991
Non gawker link?
2992
Best link I've clicked on in a long while.
2993
Those are some gansta chromatophores.
2994
This is so awesome :D
2995
This was the greatest thing ever.
2996
the internet can die happy now.
2997
i was expecting the octopus to get high
2998
Who needs milkdrop when you have squid fins! ?
2999
Is there a way to watch this in Germany?
3000
WOA WOA WOA HOLD UP "professors of sexology" WHERE THE FUCK DO I SIGN UP FOR THAT
3001
Amazing
3002
OK, so I imagine all the stuff outside the neuron is some sort of synaptic thing?
3003
Was this done In Vitro or In Vivo? (I hope I'm using the right terms her, if not, apologies).
3004
I'm asking because I wonder what the things outside the cell are - are they neurotransmitters?
3005
Other proteins?
3006
It sounds like this is talking about protein that's taken up to rebuild the cell, not neurotransmitters?
3007
But I imagine it works in a similar way?
3008
Just stuff floating around and then, zap, directly to the dendrite (? or is it axon.
3009
a comment below says axon, but the video looks like what I expected a dendrite to be based upon wikipedia), even pausing in the middle to take the path it needs to go, as if drawn by a force to the proper receptor.
3010
I found that fascinating how the stuff outside just kinda paused at a certain point then darted directly to the location it had to go.
3011
Fascinating look.
3012
i wish i could upvote this enough to keep it at the top of the front page for a month
3013
makes you think don't it?
3014
at o.07s - 0.08 sec at the bottom of the video there is a thingy that makes a 180 degree turn.
3015
Looks like a kind of worm or something.
3016
Anybody got a minute to explain a little further what happend to it to decide to go back?
3017
its sad to see people accepting this type of information as truth.
3018
some vaccines contain derivative of mercury (thimerosal) mercury being a extremely damaging neurotoxin.
3019
the medical system is a business and is treated as one.
3020
each one of those now has to be made in to a baby, otherwise you're committing murder
3021
I wonder what the success rate of these stem cells are.
3022
If you are not able to breathe, you wouldn't probably last past 30 minutes.
3023
thats awesome way to go
3024
so. you're saying i can be bestfriends with a whale and/or dolphin?
3025
This will revolutionize the underwater porn industry.
3026
So, they inject fat directly into your bloodstream?
3027
So when your unconscious, you're gasping for air, and when you awake, you might be straining to breath, as a fat man?
3028
For pity's sake, 14 year olds essentially do this with Axe.
3029
Back when I was a teen, the boys were using Drakkar.
3030
"I SMELL TREMENDOUSLY" must be some sort of awesome mating signal
3031
I think this is sound, and has merit for more study.
3032
I think our obesity deal has more causes than just this, but this could easily be one issue that is helping it along.
3033
I read a while back they were trying to make a pill or another way to re-balance our gut bacteria, and or certain food having the good active bacteria in it.
3034
Depression is connected with hippocampus shrinking, there are antidepressants which make it growth, exercises have similar effect.Literature - "Antidepressant effects of exercise: Evidence for an adult-neurogenesis hypothesis?": http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1413959/
3035
Yes. You'll notice improvements and changes about yourself and get outside, getting air and sun, or even meet new people.
3036
Many factors leading to less depression from exersize.
3037
That said, being depressed doesn't really help with motivation, which regular exersize requires quite a lot of.
3038
My experience says that doing anything NEW can help a lot with depression.
3039
Depression, at least for me, is the feeling of being stuck in an endless crappy situation and not being able to see my way out of it.
3040
The fastest way to improve mood at this point is to throw myself into a brand new learning project--preferably something I know nothing about, so that I really have to focus on the new info.
3041
Last year I learned to knit using this method.
3042
This year I am focused on bicycling.
3043
My overall situation is no better and no worse but my mind is focused away from the stuff that causes me to feel hopeless.
3044
As a guy who suffers from fairly deep depression when I'm not on a regular routine of exercise, YES IT DOES!
3045
"I'm sorry but this BBC website isn't available from the UK" - That makes perfect sense.
3046
Well done to the BRITISH Broadcasting Corporation.
3047
One thing that I have found when suffering from depression is that I feel helpless, and that my life is not under my control.
3048
I wonder if there is a difference in impact between exercise you choose to do, and exercise you are made to do (for a study).
3049
I have a job that requires me to walk outside 6 hours a day 5 days a week and I thought that the exercise and sunlight would help with my depression but I've never been more suicidal.
3050
Exercise releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, whose effects are feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.
3051
That is why people experience "runner's high".
3052
So yes, exercise will help with depression.
3053
Can I get a diagram of this?
3054
Elaborate the explanation, to make it clearer.
3055
Most destructive pip in a pair of tongs ever!
3056
Why does the article give the wave size in feet, and then details about the earthquake in meters?
3057
Stick to metric.
3058
/r/metric
3059
The scale of Japanese tsunami was nothing exceptional and the risk of tsunami was deeply understimated with Japanese nuclear energetics.
3060
In the same area the tsunami reached the height 24 m in 1933, the height 38 m in 1896.
3061
Whereas the Fukushima was destroyed with tsunami wave lower than 14 meters.
3062
It means, the Fukushima plant was not prepared even to cent-year's flood - is it really so rare event - or not?
3063
what condition would the red giant in the example be in after the supernova?
3064
Depleted to nothing significant?
3065
Still massive?
3066
Mostly undisturbed or mostly dispersed by the blast?
3067
Still don't understand why "exemptions" are even allowed in public schools.
3068
If your irrational fear of immunization is that strong, then put your kid into a private school which allows that bullshit.
3069
Keep them the hell away from mine.
3070
Just don't come crying to the government when some 19th century plague like measles or fucking smallpox ravages the student body and their family members
3071
No healthcare, no immunizations.
3072
What's interesting is the new studies linking paternal age to autism.
3073
It's not the vaccines, in other words.
3074
However, that will not sway people who Want To Believe.
3075
Is there a published list of people with "exemptions"?
3076
I would want to know if I was around someone who has made a choice that could get me or my family sick.
3077
Naive question here, but who needs herd immunity when YOU'RE VACCINATED?I can only assume it's those that are unvaccinated.
3078
Well, that's their own fault then.
3079
Despite these methodologic difficulties, the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) and other controlled epidemiologic studies have provided evidence that DTP can cause acute encephalopathy (64-68).
3080
This adverse event occurs rarely, with an estimated risk of zero to 10.5 episodes per million DTP vaccinations (68).
3081
A detailed follow-up of the NCES indicated that children who had had a serious acute neurologic illness after DTP administration were significantly more likely than children in the control group to have chronic nervous system dysfunction 10 years later.
3082
These children with chronic nervous system dysfunction were more likely than children in the control group to have received DTP within 7 days of onset of the original serious acute neurologic illness (i.e., 12 {3.3%} of 367 children vs. six {0.8%} of 723 children) (69).
3083
After reviewing the follow-up data, IOM concluded that the NCES provided evidence of an association between DTP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children who had had a serious acute neurologic illness after vaccination with DTP.

Provisional counts from our surveillance system indicate that more than 22,000 cases of pertussis were reported to CDC through August 11, 2012.
3086
13 pertussis-related deaths have been reported during that same time period.
3087
The majority of deaths continue to occur among infants younger than 3 months of age.

Is calling people a "herd" something new?
3090
I guess they really do think of us as cattle.
3091
I have a product to sell you.
3092
You need it to prevent getting ill.
3093
If you don't convince a large enough amount of the population to use my product, you will still be at risk of getting ill, even if you yourself do use my product.
3094
Seems to me like the perfect recipe for a cult.
3095
Would be a lot easier just to go back to nobody getting vaccinated so as we all develop strong immune systems.
3096
We're currently playing God, we've already seen what happens with antibiotics, we know that nature knows best, it's only the money which the vaccine industry generates that drives it.
3097
If the money wasn't there the industry would vanish overnight as there is no real need for vaccines; they are causing a lot more harm than good.
3098
Every time I dip into an article or book about ants, I am always intrigued.
3099
Then never cease to amaze me.
3100
Funny how sensationalist articles about second types of supernova discoveries and other junk gets loads of attention on reddit, only to be scolded at for not being a decent article with scientific citations, yet this gets ignored completely.
3101
Also, I didnt understand jack shit about the whole thing.
3102
Someone ELI5?
3103
Very awesome
3104
The title here is very misleading - that study only looked at the short term (7 minutes post exposure) effects of the product on metrics like blood pressure and heart rate.
3105
Saying that they "do not damage the heart" is an assumption that cannot be drawn from this article; they just do not immediately affect the heart in the same way as tradition cigarettes.
3106
That's not to say that these are not potential safer - I believe that they may be, but there's definitely a lot more research to be done.
3107
I have been vaping for three years.
3108
In those three years I've noticed quite a few things.
3109
1.) Cigarettes taste like shit.
3110
2.) My lung capacity has returned to about 97%, which definitely noticeable.
3111
3.) Electronic cigarettes, while they may not be healthy, are far and away better than cigarettes.
3112
Every ingredient in an electronic cigarette is FDA approved.
3113
Every damn one.
3114
The only thing that is not approved is the delivery system.
3115
The delivery system, alone, is enough to bring big tobacco to a very uncomfortable decline.
3116
This is what the FDA fears the most.
3117
Not your health.
3118
This study, while nowhere near as extensive as it aught to be, is about as extensive as the FDA's testing on electronic cigarettes.
3119
A handful of samples by two, out of hundreds, of suppliers, is not a study.
3120
If the FDA wants to actually study these devices they need to do a proper one.
3121
In regards to cost: The cost of a pack of cigarettes, in Maryland, is $5.75.
3122
I was a pack and a half smoker a day.
3123
In the average week I spent $60.37 per week.
3124
Over the course of one year, or 52 weeks, that is $3139.24.
3125
After three years of vaping, purchasing a total of 10 complete electronic cigarettes, ranging anywhere between $20 and $100, and two bottles of juice per month, at an average cost of $8.00 per bottle, I have spent $576 on juice and, at most, $400 on electronic cigarettes.
3126
This gives electronic cigarette cost, for me, to $976 over the course of three years.
3127
That is $325 a year, as opposed to $3139.24 a year.
3128
So, no, they do not cost "as much as, if not more than, real cigarettes."
3129
There was also an extensive study on the long term effects of USP grade propylene glycol, the main ingredient in electronic cigarette liquid, that actually provided evidence that it was not only safe but beneficial.
3130
It was said to have aided in the cleansing of the lungs and upper respiratory system.
3131
Nicotine, the addictive substance in electronic cigarettes; addictive, but not carcinogenic (cancer causing), has also been proven to be no more harmful in small amounts than caffeine.
3132
Three to four ingredients make up the liquid that is used in electronic cigarettes.
3133
Propylene glycol, USP grade, the main ingredient that makes up roughly 75-85% of the liquid (depending on strength and flavor intensity), nicotine, and flavorings (generally one flavor, or a combination of two or more).
3134
All USP food grade.
3135
All chemically safe for ingestion.
3136
I will give you a very short list of ingredients in cigarettes: Acetaldehyde Acetamide Acrylamide Acrylonitrile 2-Amino-3,4-dimethyl-3H-imidazoquinoline (MeIQ) 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido indole (Trp-P-1) 2-Amino-l-methyl-6-phenyl-1H-imidazo pyridine (PhlP) 2-Amino-6-methyldipyridoimidazole (Glu-P-1) 3-Amino-l-methyl-5H-pyrido {4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2 2-Amino-3-methyl-9H-pyridoindole (MeAaC) 2-Amino-9H-pyridoindole (AaC) 4-Aminobiphenyl 2-Aminodipyridoimidazole (Glu-P-2) 0-Anisidine Arsenic Benzanthracene Benzene Benzopyrene Benzofluoranthene Benzofluoranthene Benzofluoranthene Benzofuran Beryllium 1,3-Butadiene This is just A through B of a list of carcinogens found in traditional cigarettes.
3137
The list is quite extensive.
3138
This post will probably get buried, but this is the way it is.
3139
Electronic cigarettes should definitely be studied at a greater extent, but it needs to be done properly on both ends.
3140
We need to stop pussy-footing it and get to the bottom of the dispute so that it can be put to rest for good.

3144
It depends.
3145
If a person enjoys the occasional cigarette here and there then it is safe to say that that person is better off enjoying the occasional vape here or there on an electronic cigarette.
3146
No matter how much you smoke vaping is still safer.
3147
There was this kid at my work who smoked one of these.
3148
One of the first days he was working, he asked if he could ''charge his cigarette'' on the computer.
3149
They let him, but it was just weird hearing that.
3150
Another manager comes in later in the day and sees the cigarette and it was charged and lit green.
3151
Not knowing it was an electronic cigarette, the manager goes ''what do we have wi-fi now?''
3152
I've been using the E-Cig for about 6 months now, and I feel much better than I did when I was smoking cigarettes.
3153
It's still a bad habit -- and an expensive one.
3154
I've cut back on my usage from the doubles (~400 puffs) to the singles (~200 puffs), and I'm hoping to stop altogether within the coming months.
3155
But, so far I've noticed I have much more energy.
3156
I'm less depressed, and I worry about my body a lot less.
3157
I used to freak out at the slightest cough, worried it was something much worse.
3158
I recently started biking again, and I feel like I can go further, and push harder than I could when smoking actual tobacco.
3159
I've turned my friends onto the E-Cig.
3160
Some have stuck with it; others not so much.
3161
It seems the ones who still want to smoke cigarettes weren't into it, but the folks ready to give up loved it.
3162
TL;DR I love my the E-Cigs.
3163
They've helped me stop smoking tobacco and had an overall positive effect.
3164
I "vape" an e-cig, going on almost 2 years.
3165
I use Joye 510 e-cig kits (batteries and atomizers) and use the drip method.
3166
I spend maybe $20 per month total, although I do make my own e-juice.
3167
If I didn't make my own e-juice, I would spend maybe $35 per month.
3168
I almost certainly consume more nicotine than I ever did smoking cigarettes, and its not because I "need it."
3169
I have absolutely zero desire to smoke a cigarette again and wouldn't even PREFER them over my e-cig even given the fact that e-cigs are essentially completely harmless in every way.
3170
I am just as addicted to nicotine as I ever was, but it's MUCH cheaper, I smell nice, can vape anywhere, health blah blah.
3171
If you are spending enough money on e-cigs to where you think it's expensive, you seriously need to stop buying the horribly overpriced, PIECES OF FUCKING SHIT e-cig kits you find in brick-and-mortar stores like tobacco outlets.
3172
They fucking suck and they're fucking expensive.
3173
I can't stress this enough.
3174
I smoked a pack of day of Marlboro reds before I started vaping.
3175
The transition was absolutely painless and as far as my "addiction" is concerned, there was no change.
3176
I buy my e-cig kits from cignot.com and often get supplies (for e-juice or mixing) from myfreedomsmokes.com.
3177
For the awesome forum about everything e-cigs, check out e-cigarette-forum.com
3178
You can buy pretty much any flavor of e-juice you could ever imagine.
3179
Thousands upon thousands of different flavors.
3180
Fruit flavors, coffee and cappuccino flavors, minty flavors, chocolate flavors, beer and alcohol flavors.anything.
3181
Some guy even created flavors for a full Thanksgiving feast, including ones for turkey, mashed potatoes, corn, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, etc.and they actually tasted right.
3182
E-cigs (at least the decent ones and supplies you find online) is by far the best kept secret that very few smokers actually try.
3183
It's not the patch.
3184
It's not the gum.
3185
It's not a smoking bandaid that can maybe help you ease off nicotine to help you quit.
3186
E-cigs are a total fucking replacement altogether, and while you could use them to step down your nicotine doses (and quite easily as well).I've never looked at them like that.
3187
They've simply replaced cigarettes for me, and they're so cheap and so non-harmful that I could give a fuck whether I quit or not.
3188
Edit: I see some people are a little confused as to the point of e-cigs vs cigarettes.
3189
To briefly sum up some of the above: I am addicted to nicotine.
3190
E-cigs deliver more than sufficient (more than cigarettes for me) nicotine to me.
3191
E-cigs are fantastically cheaper than cigarettes.
3192
E-cigs don't smell, aren't harmful to your health, and don't burn shit.
3193
There is literally no single advantage to smoking cigarettes over vaping, to me.
3194
I can't even give cigarettes the "more enjoyable" category.
3195
Granted, I would have given cigarettes the "more enjoyable" category anytime within about the first 1-2 months of me vaping.
3196
But it would have been close and that had absolutely nothing to do with nicotine, addition, and withdrawal.just
3197
what I would have preferred given a choice based on enjoyment alone.
3198
I was far from hurting.I wasn't hurting at all.
3199
I've been smoking a Volcano Inferno for almost 2 years now.
3200
Drip tip allows me to drip liquid in and puff away.
3201
$11 lasts me 2 months.
3202
I've had some crappy brand e-cigs though.
3203
Don't judge them all based on one.
3204
My dad had a heart attack last year due to smoking for about thirty years.
3205
He survived thankfully and the cardiologist told him that switching to electronic cigarettes would not damage his heart.
3206
Both my parents quit the normal conventional smoking and use these now.
3207
I have been using electronic cigarettes for the last 10 months or so and to say it has changed my life would be an understatement, I can breath again, i can smell and taste unlike i can ever remember, i can walk up and down the stairs at home and not feel affected in any way.
3208
My skin is clearer and my fingernails are growing where they had grown very slowly before, yes a strange side effect but one i noticed within 4 months.
3209
My sex life is amazing and i feel like an al around better person, not as frustrated or tense as i used to be.
3210
I investigated e-cigs for a few weeks before i started using them and i had absolutely no withdrawal effects , no cravings apart from times in the first 6 weeks where i was looking for a cigarette out of habit more than wanting one, i order all my kit and spares directly from china and spend approximately ?100 a year at the most.
3211
I used to smoke 40 or more cigarettes a day and everyone i knew from family to friends did not believe I could totally stop.
3212
Now they love the smell of my house, from apples to pears and mint and other exotic smells, they all make a game of it trying to guess some of the stranger ones like tirimasu or rum and butter.
3213
Smoking was killing me but electronic cigarettes have changed my life and i suspect given me more time to spend with my children and hopefully my grandchildren, anyone who does not belive they work really needs to try them , and not because they want to stop just to replace the old stinkies.
3214
How i started you ask.well my wife saw them in Tesco a supermarket and i thought why not , 1 cost the same as a packet of cigarettes and only lasted three hours at the rate i smoked, but now that same e-cig would probably last me a full day if i had to cut back, and it is rather easy to cut down a bit, even though there are slight nicotine cravings after a while.
3215
One suggestion to anyone trying, join one of the many ecig forums and ask advice and questions, you will find many people more than happy to help and give there advice.
3216
What's even better is that e-cigs dont produce smoke, that means that my health won't be compirised if others smoke e-cigs around me.
3217
It is true that because e-cigarettes only produce water vapor it is significantly safer to be around someone who is smoking one compared to a cigarette.
3218
My wife smoked since she was 14. Nothing could break that awful habit and our marriage was on the rocks for a while because of it.
3219
She'd always leave during anything just to get another smoke.
3220
We switched to e-cigarettes and she quit on her own two months later.
3221
Just because.
3222
I know e-cigarettes use nicotine the same as cigarettes, but my wife is not the first person to completely quit thanks to them.
3223
I recommend them to absolutely anyone who smokes, whether or not you're trying to quit.
3224
Plus you can smoke then anywhere, which is nice.
3225
I am seriously considering switching to these to ween myself off nicotine.
3226
I smoke 7-8 cigarettes a day.
3227
A friend of mine uses e-cigs and he keeps adjusting the level of nicotine lower.
3228
I know a lot of it is willpower but I want to quit and quitting is half the battle.
3229
If you smoke that little, you'll probably end up increasing your nicotine intake with e-cigs.
3230
still probably a net win on the health front.
3231
Does anyone else read this title and think: No shit?
3232
As a heart patient, this makes my day!
3233
In your face, cardiologist!
3234
The nicotine could have some effect on it.
3235
I feel it's obvious that the smoke is the major part of cigarettes being harmful, but it is important to confirm that ecigs are safe before the FDA comes after them.
3236
It's the hobbiness of it all that does it.
3237
I work at an e-cigarette shop, and though in our store we can't tell you there are better for you (due to policies and insurance) as a year long user, I have felt an overwhelming positive change.
3238
I recommend every smoker at least try electronic cigarettes, put in the 70 dollars to attempt it, and I promise it will help you.
3239
I haven't seen many people say "yea i tried it and they suck" unless it was a 7-11 electronic cigarette or they had bad service at their shop.
3240
At the very least look into them, even if you aren't a smoker, so that we can all spread this information to people who could greatly benefit from it.
3241
As a female who uses a silver bullet mod daily I am absolutely thrilled to hear this.
3242
I switched to e cigs a little over a year ago and I do feel so much better for it.
3243
I can breathe and food tastes amazing again!
3244
This habit is way less expensive for me too.
3245
You just have to find the right suppliers or make ur own e liquids.
3246
I try to convert smokers when i can because it feels sooo much better.Yay for electronic cigarettes!
3247
This is a video presentation by the Dr. who did the study with more detail.
3248
Starts around 22 min.
3249
WHy should they when there's no smoke involved.
3250
I never thought they did
3251
So, I could smoke e-cigarettes and be totally fine?
3252
This is a misleading title.
3253
This shows that nicotine is not absorbed as quickly with an e-cig than with a real paper cig.
3254
That is all.
3255
This study has NOTHING to do with long term effects of E-cig use.
3256
for anyone considering an ecig There are a million models, many suck.
3257
If you don't want to do the research buy an Ego C type B with the twist battery.
3258
This is the most extensible kit available and will provide you with the best experience by far.
3259
Good luck.
3260
For anyone interested in e-cigs my suggestiin is go to 711 and buy a njoy pro kit(20 dollars) for testing to see if it works for you.
3261
If so then go to www.madvapes.com
3262
and behold the superior and cheaper options available to you.
3263
I reccomend an ego with passthrough connection some of the clear ego cartomizers and cheesecake juice (24 mg)
3264
I quit smoking in November 2011.
3265
Last month, my cravings were so bad I could hardly stand it.
3266
I was going to buy another pack of cigarettes.
3267
I figured I'd give the E-cig a try instead.
3268
I love it!
3269
I started with Madvapes 510 disposable.
3270
I've since graduated to the T-Rex which I really like as well.
3271
Not to be excessively picky, but I believe that 'seen' is preferable to 'heard,' as (to the layman) 'heard' would imply some sort of mechanical wave being transmitted.
3272
Anyhow, this is a cool accomplishment, and thanks for sharing!
