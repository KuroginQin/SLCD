I watch Annie Hall a few times each year.
1
I can't think of another movie that resonates with me as much as it does.
2
Blade Runner - "All of those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
3
Time to die."
4
Poignant, beautiful, touching.
5
This was my fault, I watched it twice.
6
Great film.creative
7
and unique.
8
Hardy is much betterthan in Dark Kinght.which is not his fault, there's just not much to do with a character wearing a mask.
9
.because after an amazing beginning and the first chase scene its a frigging mess.
10
James Bond does not play texas hold 'em.
11
I loved the article.
12
Thanks for posting!
13
yay someone else noticed
14
I thought hexen would be on there.
15
The last unicorn?
16
I can't remember.
17
I think it was dark.
18
Ninja scrollApocalypse zero The cat returns (same studio that did spirited away) My neighbor toturo (sp?) Stream boy howels moving castle
19
Not my favorite director, but I would like rob zombi to make a movie without his wife in it.
20
Am I the only one that Is against remakes?
21
It's just lazy, imo.
22
but, since people are going to keep doing them, why nit take a movie that sucked, but had potential, and redo it.
23
Or, take a movie from the 70's or older.
24
Stop Fucking with movies that are cult classics or that came out not even 20 years ago.
25
Or, in some cases, not even 5 years ago.
26
Breaking the guys teeth with a hammer in old boy.
27
totally and completely fucked right up the ass.
28
But surprisingly well done.
29
The acting wasn't half bad, the soundtrack was pretty good, it looked decent.
30
It's not really a "good" movie though, it's all pure shock value with little story.
31
Xtro
32
I liked it.
33
I like the way he just seemed so out of control on those pheromones.
34
Simply put, it was shit.
35
But I can see what it was going for.
36
I too have heard about the "metaphor for the political state of things in Siberia" and I tried to apply that to the certain scenes in the movie.
37
The "newborn porn" could be a metaphor for the Serbian government screwing over Serbians from the moment they are born?
38
Sure, I get it, but to literally show that?
39
Hmm.
40
I'm from the internet, nothing offends me, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you have to.
41
I felt like drinking Jack Daniels throughout it though.
42
Shock value for the sake of shock value and an attempt to justify it with a political metaphor in the hopes of claiming it as art.
43
Trite, shallow, and pathetic.
44
Serbian film is suspenseful, good acting, hilarious, decent actors, but all the weird shit is what drive people away.
45
It didnt phase me as much as it should have.
46
I did think some parts were fucked up.
47
I overall thought it wasnt a bad film though actually and I will give I intend to watch it again someday.
48
It should be noted that there are actually a few cuts of this film floating around.
49
3-4 maybe more.
50
I thought I got the most uncut version but apparently even mine was missing a minute or 2 of footage.
51
Does anyone else see a face in the dark in this picture
52
Steamboy.
53
- It's an epic steampunk adventure.
54
Starts a bit slow, but you won't regret it.
55
If there's a fist fight between Chris Hemsworth and Kim Jong Un, I'll watch it.
56
What really bugged me was that there were absolutely no guards around the hole.
57
Not even fences or anything that would prevent people (friends, relatives etc.) to come along with a rope and help the prisoners to climb out.
58
Inland Empire - Although I liked the film the second time I saw it, the film was amazing the first time I viewed it.
59
Princess Mononoke - My first Miyazaki film, I would love to see this film for the first time again.
60
And not a film, but the entire Twin Peaks series.
61
But I'm A Cheerleader - Great LGBT comedy about this girl whose family and friends send her to a reparative therapy camp to 'make her straight'.
62
Man With The Screaming Brain - Not your typical comedy, but it has Bruce Campbell in it.
63
Dude Where's My Car? - If you like The Hangover, you will probably like this movie.
64
The Exorcist is in my top five movies of all time for the simple reason that the dialogue is so well done.
65
Even the foreign help is played deftly and realistically.
66
The fear factor in that movie derives from its complete believability.
67
The Three Amigos and Kung Pow:Enter the Fist.
68
Guilty pleasures both but people don' t shun me for the former.
69
Human Centipede 2
70
In Bruges is one of the best black comedies ever.
71
If that's your style, you' ll love it.
72
Das Boot.
73
It's an incredible film, funny, gripping, terrifying, exciting.
74
But it's 3.5h long, and absolutely *needs to be watched in a completely dark room with the sound up (the sound is a practically a character in the movie).
75
As a result I only ever watch it in the Winter.
76
You need a good stretch of darkness, to watch it, preferably not in the middle of the night.
77
Plus, if it's a rainy/cold winter evening, the world seems to slow down outside.
78
Makes for a perfect atmosphere to engross yourself in the film.
79
Dear lord tell me you've seen Vanishing Point.
80
It's essentially US highway porn.
81
Note: There was a recent thread about it, which you should not read.
82
Godfather.
83
Absolutely Godfather.
84
And not just because it is a masterpiece of comedy, character drama, cinematography, writing, etc. I'd want to experience my first time with Godfather again, because of how familiar I thought the film was before I watched it, yet how utterly unexpected it turned out to be, blowing away all my conceptions of the film.
85
The first viewing of that movie completely shattered my extremely high expectations and preconceptions; it was almost impossible to imagine that it could do so.
86
For anybody who hasn't seen it yet, for whom it's on their list, but they just haven't been 'in the right mood for it', please, please do yourself a favour and go watch it.
87
You will be surprised at how Godfather is completely unlike what you are expecting.
88
Joyously so.
89
It's one of those films that has entered the public psyche, one which has influenced people nearly universally, regardless of whether they've seen it.
90
Just about everybody has seen or heard (or repeated themselves) countless references to it, quotes from it, clips of it, or films heavily influenced by it.
91
Indeed, a poll at lovefilm revealed that 30% of people have admitted to lying about having watched it.
92
This is no doubt due to a combination of being embarrassed at having never seen 'one of the greatest films', but probably also due to the fact, that one can somewhat easily 'pass' as somebody who has seen it.
93
You can talk about parts of the movie with great familiarity, despite never having seen it.
94
For all the people that haven't watched it, there's a rather large 'memory sense' for the movie.
95
There's a strong feeling of familiarity, even though it's a 2nd or 3rd party (or greater) knowledge.
96
I remember watching Godfather for the first time, around 15 years ago.
97
As a movie buff, I had a very strong 'memory sense' or 'feel' for the film, but when I watched it, I was blown away.
98
Godfather is wonderfully, startlingly surprising.
99
Certainly all the classic and clichéd parts are there ("make him an offer he can't refuse", "sleeps with the fishes", Brando's voice and bull-dog visage, etc).
100
These will be familiar, and yet incredibly more impressive in context.
101
They're not the clichéd tropes you're so used to from popular culture when you watch them in the film, they're powerful, nuanced, and perhaps most impressive of all, they're still effective, despite the truckloads of pop-culture baggage that comes with them for today's viewer.
102
But it's the parts that aren't as quoted or clipped or spoofed that are so wonderful.
103
First, it's a surprisingly beautiful film.
104
The wedding scene at the very beginning, the music throughout, the sets and costumes, and the cinematography are all pitch-perfect and absolutely gorgeous.
105
Then there's the dialog, which is amazingly real.
106
It has that strong feel of a 70s movie where not every line of dialog furthers the plot, where you are watching real characters live their lives, instead of acting in a teleplay.
107
And of course, the familial themes which run throughout are much more powerful than just the mafioso 'Family' stereotypes one might expect.
108
The relationships between Michael and his father and Michael and his brothers, Vito's conflict with decisions that Michael makes throughout, Enzo the baker's arc, the struggle Kay faces, etc.
109
These and so many more showcase the real honest struggles that so many characters endure in order to keep their family together and healthy.
110
They are pervasive throughout the film, and they serve to underscore beautifully the criminal aspect on the very surface of the film, layering those foreign concepts of violence with something that every viewer can truly identify with.
111
I wish I could watch Godfather again for the first time.
112
While I love it, it is by no means my favourite movie, and while I'd say that it does get even better with re-watching, it was that first time that was absolutely magical.
113
TL;DR: The first viewing of Godfather, what I thought was a familiar film, was a wholly unexpected, yet truly wonderful experience.
114
While I think it's hard to argue that he's lost much of his critical bite (ha!), I don't think your assessment of his numerical rating scale is necessarily fair.
115
With a numerical rating system, like IMDB's 1-10 based system, I apply the following logic: 5 is the mid-point.
116
It should be 5.5, as there's no ability to give a zero, but that needlessly complicates, and I simply plug the zeros in the 1 column if necessary, emulating a 0-10 scale).
117
The way I use that is that a movie that I think is neither good nor bad gets a 5.
118
If a movie is good at all, if it has any overall redeeming qualities, it will get at least a 6, which would be equivalent to 2.5/4 stars on Ebert's scale).
119
It's important to note that I rate each movie on what it is trying to achieve.
120
A film like Airplane! may get an 8/10, but that isn't even on the same scale as one like Everything is Illuminated, also an 8/10.
121
Each is a different work with different aims, different expectations, and different qualities.
122
This is similar to the way that a poem cannot really be compared on the same scale with the lyrics of a great song, despite their relatively similar constructs.
123
As a song a great poem can be poor and as a poem a great song can also be poor.
124
In much the same way as a 'late nite comedy' a film like Schindler's List is dreadful.
125
The thing is that I think a very small percentage of mainstream movies are "bad" as an overall work.
126
Many of them have little or no good in them, but it takes a true train-wreck to be wholly bad, and drop below 5/10.
127
These happen, but are rare (especially for Hollywood big-releases, and doubly-so for films that are shown to critics).
128
With Ebert's 0-4 scale, with the "range from Zero stars (beneath contempt) to Four stars (first-rate)", two stars might mean that he thinks the work has overall no redeeming qualities in what it sets out to do.
129
Even through it may not indicate a work that is 'poor' overall, that's actually a pretty poor review.
130
For the same reasons I shared above, he may not necessarily think that that is accurate for the vast majority of films he reviews (naturally, there are some overall, abject stinkers).
131
As a result, he's going to be giving a lot more 3-star reviews, which on his 9-step scale is half-way between 'not good at all' and 'first rate', but still quite a bit above 'beneath contempt' (which, while it happens, is exceedingly hard for a film to achieve in my opinion).
132
TL;DR: Three stars out of 4 isn't great.
133
It's good, maybe a little better than mediocre, but not bad, and certainly not great.
134
I think that describes the vast majority of film releases to theaters these days.
135
Amazingly underrated film.
136
Marketed so poorly.
137
Most animated features are for kids, with elements that appeal to adults.
138
Rango was for adults, not kids, but was marketed as a kids comedy.
139
Further, the film was amazingly, beautifully artistic, but for some reason, they hid all of its beauty from the trailers, instead showing some of the dreariest, least detailed scenes.
140
Naturally, it was also a wonderful showcase for some of the amazing talents of Johnny Depp.
141
I strongly recommend it.
142
It's complex, layered, sophisticated, hilarious, beautiful, dark etc.
143
It is "worth a damn" as Royal Tenenbaum would say.
144
Plus, fans of film will love that it is absolutely chock full of quality movie references, homages, and themes (not just the type of 'winking at the camera' nods that modern spoof movies do).
145
When Rango does his first nasal clearing PHHHNUUAAAAH!
146
near the beginning of the movie, the wife and I looked at each other incredulously and knew we were in for a treat.
147
(Do yourself a favour and see The Odd Couple if you didn't catch that super subtle reference.)
148
Lucky Number Slevin!
149
I was so blown away at the ending it was a great plot twist.
150
A robin hood movie that is actually about him stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.
151
Make it edgy, violent, and make robin hood and his band a group of morally ambiguous characters (good cause, though they still are stealing and sometimes killing).
152
A midieval heist movie, basically.
153
I've wanted to write something like this myself actually
154
Green Lantern
155
Has anyone seen human centipede 2?Because, shit.
156
Eyes Wide Shut
157
Fear and Loathing, while not truly a hippie movie, is a great examination of the culture on its decline
158
Is the Shining a good novel?
159
I haven't read it but I think the movie is fantastic
160
Ong bak
161
Twelve Monkeys goddamn I love that movie
162
Vesper was under the impression that Quantum had kidnapped her boyfriend and that unless she helped them they would kill him.
163
So I am assuming that since they set up the meeting with Le Chiffre and the Africans at the beginning that they wanted Le Chiffre to get the money back, therefore they probably told Vesper not to let Bond buy back in just in case he actually beat Le Chiffre.
164
Unfortunately Bond gets back in the game and he wins, it is at THIS point that Quantum no longer cares about Le Chiffre and they just want the money, so they send Mr. White to kill Le Chiffre and tell Vesper to steal the money.
165
Harold and Maude?
166
Someone asked this exact same question in /r/askreddit and I'm gonna repeat what I said there: replace Keanu in the Matrix with Tay Zonday.
167
Outlaw Vern, that guy knows his shit.
168
Half a Loaf of Kung Fu - one of Jackie Chan's funniest films with fantastic fight sequences.
169
2LDK - an extremely hilarious, dark comedy about two young actresses sharing a flat in Tokyo while vying for the same role.
170
Ichi the Killer - another dark comedy, wacky gangster flick by Takeshi Miike (Audition, 13 Assassins) If nothing else, definitely check out 2LDK!
171
This sounds like an X-Men christmas movie.
172
now post a pic of Johnny Depp bathing.
173
I fear it is a shot that shall never come
174
Most of my reccommendations are written already, so I'll just write High Fidelity if she wants a slightly different take on the romcom thingy :)
175
"What's your number?" is pretty funny and still quite recent.
176
"Milk".
177
While not exactly a hippie movie it is set in a similar time and is very strong.
178
TIL Stan Lee hates black people.
179
Makes me wonder if what Stan and Frank Miller think of each other.
180
I didn't think Daredevil was bad, there was possibly a little too much brooding and too much focus on him and electra.
181
No Captain America 1990?
182
Roger Cormans Fantastic Four?
183
Which was actually pretty good, better than the one we got, no spider man 3! Hulk wasn't too big, he was the right size.
184
No X-Men 3, which I enjoyed actually, or Wolverine?
185
I liked the future war/combat story element too.
186
Sam Rockwell, who's talents are immensive, and he shits all over Gosling and his "versatileness", and.
187
Michelle Williams, it was harder for me to pick the actress rather than the actor, subject to change.
188
Robert Downey Jr and Liv Tyler?
189
Alien/Predator Nightmare On Elm Street/Friday The 13th/Evil Dead, ED Necronomicon shows up in Jason Goes To hell.
190
60s Batman and 60s Green Hornet!
191
There was a couple crossover epidodes, and they're awesome!
192
This one might be a bit of a stretch, but.
193
The Devils Backbone And Pans Labyrinth, both are about Kids in war, boy in TDB takes place during Spanish Civil War, PL and the girl in world war 2, and both have the supernatural world, and they have been referenced, well, at leas PL, as a sequel in spirit.
194
Oh, here's one Indiana Jones and The Marvel movieverse Captain America.
195
In the beginning of Captain America, when Red Skull finds the Tesseract, he claims "And the furher?, spelled right?, digs for trinkets in the dessert!", can only be a reference to Raiders and the nazis looking for the ark, and given that Joe Johnston did the visual effects on Raiders, and both are paramount franchises.
196
So that means that all the marvel movieverse stories, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, all take place in the same storyline/chronology/continuity as Indiana Jones.
197
Fucking awesome if you ask me.
198
The Universal Monsters, how many times did Dracula, Wolf Man, and Frankenstein fight one another?
199
The Big Lebowski and Fargo When Del Fino confronts The Dude after his coitus session with Maude aka Lady Friend, and is looking for Bunny aka Dawn Knudsen, he shows the Dude a picture of the Knudsen family farm in I believe it's Moosehead?
200
, just outside of Fargo,North Dakota.
201
The Big Lebowski and Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends.
202
Now, I haven't ever seen that Fosters show, but I have seen the screen shots of Dude, Donnie, and Walter's cameos.
203
Oh, and possibly.
204
The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old men.
205
Remember when, oh, spoiler.
206
Spoiler and then there's that scene in NCFOM where Llewelyn, is talking to someone about his Nam experience, hint, hint, and he mentions the unit/troop he was in, I've been meaning to check to see if it's the same one Walter says in that scene.
207
Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan/The Longest Day,Patton, Munich.
208
I don't mean that as a sick joke either.
209
Taxi Driver and Hardcore.
210
Paul Schraeder, who wrote both, but only directed Hardcore, which is an excellent, dramatically compelling movie, crossed the two over.
211
Plot of Hardcore: George C.Scotts daughter, who, they're all part of the Dutch Calvinist community, somewhat personal for Schraeder, goes on a churh trip, and, she gets lured into doing porno flicks.
212
Anyways, when he and his friends and family are looking for her, he's talking to someone on the phone, he says "Thank you Mrs.Steensma" right before he hangs ups.
213
Steensma, is of course, the last name or Iris, Jodie Fosters child prostitute character in Taxi Driver.
214
Oh, and for the Tarantinoverse debate, don't forget True Romance.
215
Patricia Arquettes Alabama is the same Alabama Mr.White mentions in Reservoir Dogs.
216
I believe Natural Born Killers as well, doesn't Seymour Scagnetti show up in that?
217
Couple others: Kurosawas Yojimbo, and Zatoichi: Blind Swordsman, been a couple crossovers.
218
And as for Tarantino verse, Kill Bill Takes place in The same timeline of the japanese tv show, shadow warriors, which is where the original Hatori Hanzo came from.
219
Power Rangers/Ninja Turtles, they crossed over, and does anyone else remember Masked Rider?, which crossed over with Power Rangers.
220
Did VR Troopers fit into that at all?
221
Aw fuck, that's tough.
222
I'm really gonna have to think on this one.
223
He's one of those guys who for me, almost all of his stuff is too good for me to pick just one favorite.
224
Well, what about brothers who wave the confederate flag?
225
They ever consider that?
226
What's more racist?
227
The flag it's self, or saying that black people can't make up their own mind on the issue?
228
Your brother sounds awesome, and you should sincerely encourage him to do these.
229
I want to see Home Alone Meets The Lost Highway.
230
I'd be there opening day.
231
The possibilities are endless.
232
it seems the music is so magical it made you forget all the actual good music that did happen in the last 10 years.
233
If they can't get Bale to play Batman then GTFO
234
Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Portman
235
Have you seen any of the Charlie Chan films?
236
They are old, and not particularly stylish by modern standards, but still great movies.
237
did anyone mention Lucky Number Slevin yet?
238
That's a great picture
239
Perhaps someone could explain to me why this is appealing.
240
An actor who can convince the audience of a genuine emotion is part of what makes masters so appealing.
241
An actor who drinks on set to play a drunk, isn't really acting anymore.
242
But will Tom Hardy be super swole?
243
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy YAY! Tobey McGuire is also attached ehhhhhhhh
244
What was that?
245
Tom.Tom Hardy?
246
Here's my money.
247
Oh what's that?
248
Leo as well, you say?
249
Here's some more money.
250
Woo! I'll watch anything with Hardy in it.
251
I miss seeing Tobey in movies, too.
252
He was great in Brothers.
253
I'm just waiting for Bale and Hardy to reunite in a movie.
254
As an animal lover I feel like this would be difficult to watch.
255
Yes, but who is going to direct?
256
Prometheus.
257
It made me cry it was so damn bad.
258
Hunger Games also.
259
Mr Smith Goes to Washington always gets to me for some reason.
260
Frank Capra is always accused of being corny, but he always balances out with sadness.
261
Honest people being destroyed by the American system of government is too real.
262
We Bought a Zoo.
263
I don't think more than 5 minutes went by where I didn't burst into tears.Also Up but that has already been mentioned a few times.
264
Requiem For A Dream.
265
Also, my wife can't watch The Time Traveler's Wife because it's too sad and upsetting to her.
266
Marley and me
267
Martyrs.
268
I know it's known for being a sad film, it's more of a horror/gore film.
269
But the last 20 minutes or so with Anna, especially the very end I just felt really sad.
270
He did not climb it all the way up because the rope does not go all the way to the top and there was not anything to grab onto at the zenith.
271
The thing about Terminator Salvation that most people don't realize is that everybody involved in the making of it has no recollection of it ever being made.
272
The truth is, they didn't.
273
Terminator Salvation was designed in the future to simply look like a film made by McG and starring Christian Bale to lull us into a false sense of security.
274
It was sent back in time to kill another Terminator trilogy before it was ever born.
275
Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.
276
It's such a beautiful.
277
just really fucking beautiful film.
278
It's a feast for the eyes.
279
Seeing it for the first time as a child, it was greater than any Disney movie.
280
I wish I could see it with that sense of awe again.
281
It's still beautiful, but I know that now and am prepared for it.
282
Just participate in the thread on this that was started last week.

Anger management and Billy madison
286
How about just plain old Labyrinth?
287
Never mind the "Pan's".
288
I really enjoyed Pandorum and (like myself) the people who seem to enjoy this film are those who enjoyed films like Event Horizon.
289
I also enjoyed The Descent, In the Mouth of Madness and The Faculty also mentioned in other comments.
290
I have a very mixed movie collection (all bought none downloaded (of the shock of it!)
291
One of the great things about Pandorum, at least I thought so, was the fact that you did not really know where it was going.
292
It had a great mix of suspense and just enough WTF to catch you by suprise - and of course Dennis Quaid!
293
I agree that it was underrated, unfortunatley some films go that way - mainly due to marketing and publishing.
294
Films like Prime, K20 (Japanese), Absentia, They, eXistenZ and Ironsky (the list if far longer) deserve more recognition than they have actually got.
295
I really enjoyed it as well.
296
It was pretty scary and also had that suspense going for it.
297
The twist was really cool too.
298
I hope this one becomes a cult classic, because I believe it deserves to be one.
299
to be fair, the movie is a mixture of awesome and bad.
300
I think of it as a movie adaptation of Le papillon des étoiles.
301
I too liked Pandorum, not as a horror movie but a good original Sci-fi action movie.
302
Nice visuals and good pace for me.
303
I enjoyed it because I'm always looking for a good space travel scifi/horror.
304
It had elements of many other movies of that genre, but why shouldn't it?
305
Solid ending.
306
Watched it a few years ago with my wife and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
307
Didn't expect it to exceed my expectations, but it did.
308
IMDB movie scores are shit, and completely pointless.
309
Along those lines, horror movies all have shit scores on IMDB, Never, ever look at an imdb score for guidance.
310
I watched this because I was looking for a cool sci-fi flick and the premise seemed alright.
311
The beginning was interesting but then they showed the zombie alien monsters or whatever and it turned really generic.
312
I didn't finish watching it so maybe I missed out but it seemed like another rehash of a generic survival movie.
313
Because it's a really, really terrible movie.
314
Because it's clichéd and unoriginal.
315
It's bad movie.
316
Worse, it's a bad movie that could have been an awesome movie.
317
The ending is sort of genius, and I'd love to see a film with that ending that wasn't dumb, tedious, muddled and amateurish all the way through.
318
You can make comparisons to Alien, Event Horizon, the Descent.
319
but I think the movie it most resembles is Doomsday, both in terms of quality and of the type of creature running around.
320
I am in the minority that enjoyed both Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation (double minority!)
321
Each Terminator movie brings different atmosphere.
322
And different setups.
323
Enjoyed all of them.
324
The villain in Terminator 3 was unique, maybe not as cool as that metal-transforming villain in Terminator 2, but still cooler than the usual Arnold Terminator.
325
No particular memorable villains in Terminator Salvation, but the idea of the machine protagonist who doesn't know he's a machine and is not so nice with John Conner added an interesting conflict/mystery element to the film.
326
Best western of the year, with an asymmetric protagonist!
327
I am unable to see any of the new animated movies in theaters since our cinemas only show the local language versions of the movie.
328
I think it's a complete disrespect towards the art.
329
They dub the movie with the local actors in a weekend and push it like it's the only way to watch.
330
I'm mad about it but there is nothing I can do but not go and see them.
331
Surprised no one has mentioned Carpenter's "They Live."
332
The rumor is that the fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David was not staged, but actual punches.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-MVMbm6c0k
333
Orgazmo edit: I should also add- Cannibal (The Musical)
334
John Q: "I'm not going to bury my son, my son is going to bury me." and when he is heading to prison and his son says goodbye and he says "It's not goodbye son, it's see you later."
335
MIB3: When it was revealed that K was watching over J after his father died.
336
Multiple scenes in SPR, BOB, and FG.to many to mention
337
Chumbawamba - Tubthumping was used in so many kids/family movie montages back in the day.
338
I think AC/DC songs are also very overused.
339
What is this "on" concept you speak of?
340
Ah, TV, right.
341
I've not had television in nearly 14 years now.
342
Netflix is my go to source for media.
343
That said, I often fire up Shawshank Redemption when I'm out of things to watch.
344
It would also be awesome if John C. Reilly was Conway Twitty.
345
Have you ever actually listened to his lyrics?
346
I think he was a child molester.
347
"I can tell, you've never been this far before.
348
Bum bum bum"
349
I would cast death row inmates as every character, with the selection criteria being that they all are executed before the movie is finished filming, so that such a stupid idea could never be released.
350
Hollywood: just admit that you're out of fucking ideas already.
351
Slaughterhouse Five.
352
Premium Rush was well directed and just plain fun to watch.
353
It gets a little silly at times but that didnt bother me one bit in this case.
354
I dont think I would want to see it multiple times but seeing it once was hella fun.
355
Jospeh gordon levit is awesome.
356
The Road, please don't kill yourself.
357
Take this extra joy :D :) 3 Trust me, you'll need it.
358
Elektra Glide in Blue is the closest thing to a hippie cop movie.
359
Punishment Park is a grim political mockumentary about hippies and war protesters being sent to punishment camps And I suppose The Big Lebowski probably qualifies since the lead character is an aging sixties radical
360
Around the fire, surprisingly awesome, unknown movie about kids getting into the festival scene.
361
Overall it's a landslide in favor of Pixar.
362
Toy Story 3, UP!, and Wall-e were all artistic genius in my opinion.
363
They are some of the best films made in the last 10 years regardless of genre.
364
.Brave is probably my favorite Pixar movie of all.
365
I wasn't aware that everyone pretty much hated it.
366
Weird.
367
Angelina Jolie's best role
368
Loved it.
369
I saw it, but was pretty disappointed.
370
It just felt like generic feel good indie movie.
371
It wasn't at all believable and it felt like the premise for a short film, not an entire feature.
372
Great film!
373
Everyone gets an upvote!
374
Great story.
375
I kind of forgets she's not real, when I see it.
376
And there are a lot of great performances in the film.
377
Not just from Gosling.
378
i've seen it.
379
I thought it was pure genius.
380
:DAnd imagine how hard it must have been acting with something that is giving you nothing back.
381
i've seen it!
382
great acting from ryan gosling!
383
One of my fav movies that I accidently got to know of.
384
Infact it was here in Reddit.
385
Very delightful movie.
386
Loved it, it isn't exactly the easiest film to bring up in conversation though.
387
Loved that movie, very feel good attitude with it
388
I love that movie.
389
Makes me tear up a bit.
390
Spoiler Fuck, that movie really was good.
391
I saw this at the Heartland Film Festival (in Indianapolis) in 2007 and loved it.
392
While it does have some flaws, it has since been my go-to movie when I'm feeling down.
393
You should host a movie night and invite your friends who haven't seen it.
394
Provide tissues.
395
Had to watch it in school, which kinda ruined it.
396
But whenever I see it it makes me feel so happy :)
397
Tommy Lee Jones, maybe?
398
Spoiler
399
Not a movie but the ending scene of the Futurama episode "Jurassic Bark".
400
That scene is brutal.
401
I just don't really like the ending of Last Crusade.
402
I don't buy the templar.
403
For some reason.
404
I have nothing against the face melting from the Ark though.
405
It's actually pretty strange and I can't motivate it.
406
Point Break, fuck yeah.
407
Wizard of Oz. terrified me when I was little and the flying monkeys still freak me out
408
Music sharer had the opportunity to settle for $3500.
409
lol
410
Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman
411
The warg attack in The Two Towers, special effects aren't as good as the rest of the films and it isn't a very exciting scene anyway.
412
Peter Jackson actually criticizes the special effects on the commentary.
413
Tombstone.
414
came on expecting to see The Time Travellers Wife.
415
Back to the future is great.
416
:)
417
all of it
418
All of the Nolan movies!
419
And the sixth sense, I watched it too young the first time to get it.
420
Sarah's key- when the guard at the Jewish camp let sarah escape to find her brother.
421
The notebook - when they are fighting and Noah says something like "i want all of you, the good and the bad"
422
Sarah's key (everything's shitty there)The deep blue sea
423
In avengers in the big fight scene, there's this one face on shot of Loki and it looks like really bad cgi behind him.
424
It's only for a couple of seconds but I barf in my mouth every time I see it.
425
Disclaimer: None of the following is true I took my nephew to the first one and he hated it.
426
I said no man keep going star wars is great.
427
I plan to show him episode 2 and 3. He'll probably hate them but I'll say no man keep going.
428
Then we'll see episode 4 and he say it was OK but I'll say no man wait the 5th one is the best.
429
Then we'll see the 5th and he won't be as wowed about it as I was because he already knew that Darth Vador was Luke's father.
430
Then we'll see episode 6 with the ewoks.
431
TL:DR The prequels suck, make no sense and actually make the original films worse with their presence
432
This comes as a pretty big surprise because the first re-release didn't drum up too much excitement.
433
DAMN YOU, LUCAS!
434
I REFUSE TO INHALE THIS FILM.
435
Wake me up when they get to the original trilogy.
436
I might consider going if I read that the 3D conversion doesn't suck ass.
437
As for the prequels, fool me once.
438
Can't fucking wait for the gritty remakes.
439
I wish I could escape from my universe into Kevin Smith's where everyone talks in lengthy, informative monologues and you could do things like harass customers, smell like shoe polish, and fall in love with a lesbian.
440
"Who Let the Dogs Out?" I don't know who but fuck 'em.
441
Could watch this all day.
442
And the previous poster is right; this is one great misunderstood animated film.
443
The Requiem For A Dream soundtrack.
444
Seriously, every fantasy movie preview plays it.
445
That's why it's called work, the support group meets daily, at the bar.
446
Something something George Carlin.
447
Am i the only person who cannot see shit underwater, without goggles?
448
I don't know what others think, but for me Terminator Salvation was the last link in a downward spiral for the franchise.
449
T1 when I saw it was a terrifying film.
450
You have to understand the context of the time, for most people - computers and technology were not as everyday as they are now and perceptions at the time were different.
451
This film was about an unstoppable and completely emotionless killing machine trying to murder an ordinary person.
452
I would call T1 a Sci Fi Horror movie and a very good one.
453
T2 was a different entity all together.
454
It was much softer, with Arnold Character providing comic relief (complete 180 degree turn around from T1).
455
It was a solid action film with a significant threat in the form of the T1000, but a target you were less inclined to care about (Connor) because to be honest, he was a butthole.
456
I would call this a sci-fi action movie and a very good one.
457
T3 was a poor film.
458
The threat was largely absent, Arnie was a farce with his "talk to the hand" and pink glasses, and the movie limped along with really nothing other than some ok action but no one I cared anything about and no real continuity (other than character names and Arnie) from the previous films.
459
I would call this an action comedy, and not a particularly good one.
460
Terminator Salvation was even further removed from earlier elements of the franchise.
461
No character continuity (just names) - very little story continuity and a world that didn't live up to what we had seen before.
462
There were so many stories that could have been told, it is just astonishing they went with something so contrived.
463
Needlessly Introducing some random cyborg, ridiculous terminators (bike / water) that honestly just screamed of merchandising, and abandoning the dark, mass murder depicted in T1 and T2 honestly baffled me.
464
I don't know what T4 will bring, but it will need another 180 UTurn to get me back on board.
465
The series ended with the second film.
466
Everything else is fan fiction.
467
Terminator will be back.
468
why are the Arnie models of terminator called the T-800? he was a T-101 in James Cameron's terminators wasn't he?
469
I don't think Salvation killed the series but studio strife was the problem.
470
Bond was almost facing the same problem.
471
The people who owned the rights were in trouble.
472
because it was complete shite
473
It's very simple.
474
All terminator movies up until this point were sort of neo noir horror movies.
475
Now terminator 3 stands out by being a generic action movie but it still had portions of horror.
476
Salvation turned the terminator franchise on its head.
477
Within the first few scenes terminators are taken out like they are annoying barking dogs.
478
So lets set it straight, the first three films feature terminators that are so terrifying, and unstoppable you have no choice to run.
479
Then salvation comes along and we have John Connor himself blowing away various machines like they are made out of plastic.
480
Terminators were no longer killers in the sense that it was a survival horror situation.
481
Suddenly mortal humans could kill them.
482
It would be like if the first Halloween films were horror, and then suddenly anyone with a shotgun could take out Michael Myers.
483
I've noticed this about many recent sci-fi releases and I feel it holds true for Terminator: Salvation: Directors are pushing the suspension of disbelief just a bit too far.
484
I feel that directors will come up with any system of logic they can in order to justify truly insane visuals or glaring plot holes.
485
Especially with movies like those in the Terminator franchise, a filmmaker would really have to push the limits of the imagination before the audience starts toying with the film's logic.
486
I was on board with Terminator: Salvation and then they performed a heart transplant in the middle of the desert.
487
After that, for me, I just started running through all the issues that occurred prior in the film - most of which I had up until then ignored.
488
Same things happened to me in Prometheus - I was a happy audience member until I saw her run and jump and fight after a full blown alien c-section.
489
Just a domino effect, I guess.
490
That said, I agree that there is NO WAY the Terminator franchise died with Salvation.
491
There was so much to like about that film, regardless of its foibles.
492
McG, I feel, is an excellent action director and I look forward to seeing his upcoming work.
493
And, as always, check out Rampart, now streaming on Netflix.
494
I think T3 was where the franchise broke its leg.
495
Also.
496
Nick Stahl.
497
He is no John Conner.
498
In Terminator: Salvation, I don't think they did an effective job of capturing the future.
499
I wanted to see lasers man, plasma cannons in the 40 watt range.
500
Really, I'm saying a drag-out laser fight under a blackout sky between man and machine (Cameron's flashback style) for 2 hours would have been great.
501
Instead we get an unnecessary human / terminator hybrid.
502
A Kyle Reese that isn't fit to polish Michael Biehn's shoes.
503
A Max Headroom style Helena Bonham Carter, an indecisive mopey John Conner and 15 seconds of a bodybuilder with Arnold's CGI face.
504
I'm not saying I hated it (I did hate T3, pretty contrived).
505
The preview with the NIN song really had me sold on it.
506
Just like most fans of a franchise you hope for a good movie with the heart and storytelling of the originals.
507
TL:DR T3 wasn't very good and T:S fell a little flat.
508
As fun as T2 was, back in the day, it really strayed from the original's noir sensibilities.
509
After that, it's gotten progressively less "terminator" and more "movie about robots n junk"
510
T2 is the best action movie of all time
511
All they make anymore is sequels and adaptations and reboots.
512
Why can't they make anything original?
513
Hey why haven't they made an Incredibles sequel yet?
514
-- The Internet
515
Stallone as Captain Planet, then he can do another one of his "I AM.THE LAHW!" speeches, except you know, environmentally friendly.
516
When Gandalf is telling Pippin about heaven.
517
Some roles pay the bills and others he gets to be diverse.
518
I think he's more about the person in the scenario.
519
So you see a similar character but in different situations.
520
Jackie Earle Haley and Tilda Swinton
521
Raiders has so much more panache and energy.
522
Who was the female love interest/lead in Last Crusade?
523
Allison Doody?
524
Zero personality, zero character, no chemistry at all.
525
She didn't DO anything.
526
The action felt largely tired a been there/done that vibe.
527
It was more serious than Temple of Doom, but nowhere near Raiders.
528
He gave Speed 2: Cruise Control a thumbs up.
529
I stopped listening to him after that.
530
I'm glad Alicia Silverstone still gets roles.
531
I've had such a school-boy crush on her since Clueless and her other films in the mid to late 90's
532
Wasn't this movie filmed forever ago?
533
I loved Rob in Hot Tub Time Machine.
534
BUTTERS!
535
The movie!
536
We're all going to be grounded this fall.
537
Return of the Jedi.
538
When the Ewok gets shot and the other one tries to wake him up.
539
Blair Witch 2. After being terrified by the first to the point that I kept looking at the woods in my backyard for movement, it was just a run of the mill ghost story.
540
Righteous Kill.
541
De Niro and Pacino, in the same movie?
542
YES!
543
But then, not so much.
544
Alien vs Predator of course.
545
Paul W S Andercunt.
546
The Hangover II.
547
I loved Indy 4, it fit in nicely with the others.
548
In my opinion, Temple of Doom was the one that didn't fit in; it was way more dark and serious than the other ones.
549
I'm showing my age with this one but Highlander 2 was an awful disappointment.
550
they put speed racer on this list.
551
as far as i'm concerned, this list is bullshit
552
Cool Hand Luke fight scene.
553
just difficult to watch at the end I Am Legend when he kills his dog.
554
The entirety of Playing by Heart
555
Sure, if you're talking about the majority of his roles.
556
They are very similar, sure.
557
But there are several movies where he isn't the stereotypical Will.
558
Stranger than Fiction, Everything Must Go, Winter Crossing, Melinda, Bewitched, Elf, Megamind, (I would assume Casa de mi Pardre but I haven't seen it yet) and Other Guys.
559
Other Guys- he gets to play the straight man, an unconfident dork.
560
Same could be said about Bewitched.
561
Elf- yes, there are moments where he seems to be the stereotypical Will, but there are highly sincere moments where he shows you the tragedy of dealing with a father that doesn't want you, learning that the world believes there is no Santa, and has made Christmas into a commercial holiday first and foremost Megamind- I believe this is due to the limiting factor of animation, that it (for the most part) is just about the voice, so the performance is all in that.
562
Sure, before he kills Metro Man he is typical Will.
563
But once he has won, he plays up the lonliness of the character very well And in Stranger than Fiction, Everything Must Go, Winter Crossing, and Melinda and Melinda, he is highly neurotic, lacking in confidence, and highly tragic.
564
TL DR: Will Ferrell has several movies that display his versatility as an actor
565
District 9 certainly wasnt ready for that!
566
He's allegedly a complete fucking prick, but Scott Rudin.
567
The man is behind a long, long list of incredible movies.
568
I enjoyed the shit out of the first star wars film.
569
When I first watched it back around 2000 I was like 6 or 7 and dammit I enjoyed that movie!
570
Jar jar was fucking funny and the podrace was just about the coolest shit I had ever seen in a movie!
571
The fight at the end was also one of the most awesome moments I experienced in a movie at that age.
572
Hell I still enjoy it today
573
Peter Sellers and Julianne Moore.
574
Because fuck you.
575
reservoir dogs is my favorite.
576
film school.
577
honestly, this is going to sound weird, but kevin bacon and chris penn vs. the dudes at the end of footloose, at the dance.
578
it's brief, the sound effects aren't super loud, people actually go down after one or two hits.
579
actually iron man gets the most screen time.
580
it's hardly equal.
581
think about how long hulk and banner are gone?
582
mark ruffalo for banana and Norton.
583
don't waste your time.
584
that movie is dreck.
585
yeah.
586
you did.
587
but it's poorly executed.
588
the dialogue is awkward and unrealistic and it's boring as fuck.
589
if anything your point goes to show shyamalan knew a twist was expected and just left it out and lazily ends the movie.
590
‘Something Stanley Kubrick Would Be Proud Of? .Get the fuck out!
591
Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.
592
Blue Valentine was just plain awesome.
593
Great actors.
594
Die Hard 1-3 on Dec. 24, 25 and 26.
595
Every year since I was 8. My personal Wonderful Life.
596
Ctrl+F'd Man From Nowhere.
597
no entry, seriously?
598
The knife fight.
599
It's like, the best.
600
(Loud and shitty dubbing)
601
The Silence of the Lambs.
602
No one had said this?
603
The build up of suspense through out and the absolute terror of the scene in the dark basement.
604
So incredible when I didn't know how it would end!
605
I'll go with Drive.I was waiting for it a long time and it turned out to be EVERYTHING I expected and even more.
606
It's my "perfect" movie.
607
Jurassic Park, to this day still the movie I have watched in the theater the most.
608
Probably around 15 times on the big screen the first 2 months it was released.
609
Jurassic park.
610
Of all the movies I have seen in my life and in all the formats and settings watching jurassic park when i was 13 on one of the last surviving CinemaScope screens was just awesome.
611
the theatre was super old but had upgraded sound systems and the old CinemaScope screen was just massive.
612
Also you know the movie was freaking awesome, even if I still have fears of being alone in the house on the off chance a raptor may be hiding be hind a closed door Still great movie experience.
613
though i may have not answered the question right.
614
If i could watch a movie again as if it was the first time.
615
I can't name one exactly but pick any good comedy.
616
I have an issue where I just can not rewatch comedies.
617
Its like After the first time its just not funny any more.
618
when i do rewatch them i tend to just get annoyed with them, this is an issue with all movies really.
619
How ever its worse with comedies.
620
Sunshine.
621
This was the first blu ray I watched.
622
Blew me away.
623
Battle Royale
624
2001: A space Odyssey - but then again, some scenes crushed my brain the 30th time i was watching it so i dont know would it be a good thing to "unwatch" this movie.
625
would have to study it all over again also: Pulp Fiction (just wanna have that orgasmic feeling like when i watched it the 1st time),Leon, Seven, Usual Suspects, The Matrix etc.
626
The Game!
627
Warrior.
628
Tom Hardy killed it in that movie and the ending gives me the chills every time when Brendan taps out his brother and that song by The National starts playing soooo goooodddd
629
Any comedy movie.
630
As much as I love Airplane!
631
(it is my favorite movie) I wish I could just experience the jokes for the first time and not know what they're going to say.
632
Rushmore Magnolia The nightmare before Christmas
633
E.T.
634
I just thought it was completely magical and completely engrossing.
635
Fight Club
636
JAWS.
637
My favorite movie of all time.
638
I was five when my parents let me watch it on tv, because I saw that it was going to be on and I begged and begged to watch it, and they figured I'd fall asleep (because it was on late and I was young).
639
What's weird is that somehow I "knew" it was gonna be important to me.
640
Se7en, just so I could be all "OHMAGOD" again at the ending.
641
Catch me if you can, when I first saw it, it was so interesting and exiting and funny the sad.
642
I wish I could see it again without even knowing about it
643
Grave of Fireflies.
644
Life is fresh and wonderful once you ascend from the hell this movie throws you in.
645
There are so many "classic" movies that I watched when I really got into movies, but I didn't understand them then.
646
I didnt appreciate them like I do now, but I still know the story, plot beats, twists, etc. so I don't get that impact like a first time watch gets.
647
I think it sucks that I couldn't have the enjoyment of the story and the craft.
648
The Prestige
649
Terminator 2. Just going to that movie and seeing the special effects at the time was jaw dropping.
650
Nothing had been done like that before.
651
It was a pioneer in CGI.
652
Kids these days are so used to it.
653
Now get off my lawn.
654
Transformers, the superior animated movie.
655
I would like to see Oldboy again.
656
Oldboy, Fight Club, Memento, Tae Guk Gi, Forrest Gump and The Matrix.
657
Memento.
658
What a movie!
659
I've watched it so many times but the first time I did not understand it fully.
660
but it made me curious to watch it over and over again to truly understand how great a film it is.
661
Fight Club, because I was spoiled for the ending before I saw it.
662
I would love to watch it with no knowledge of the movie.
663
Also, The Shining, because I fucking love that movie.
664
And I want to experience it for the first time again.
665
Heat.
666
It was completely exhausting, but that made the ending so fufilling.
667
Scary Movie 1, Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, The Wire
668

669

The Dark Knight.
672
I went to the midnight showing with a group of a about 4 or 5 people.
673
We ran into a couple other friends there, and ended up having about 7 or 8 people all watching the movie in the same row.
674
There were the normal glances at cool parts, and appreciative nods, but after the Joker was captured my eyes weren't anywhere but the screen.
675
The most memorable part was after the end of the movie.
676
Normally when a film ends, especially midnight premieres, there's a lot of people talking about how the movie was, or what they were doing the next day, or whatever.
677
There was dead silence.
678
Everyone walked out of that room with nothing said.
679
The silence was finally broken in my group in the lobby with "So that was a pretty good movie, huh?".
680
It was like a veil was lifted.
681
Everyone blew up with talking about their favorite parts and the like.
682
The Dark Knight isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it is one of my favorites.
683
But if I had the chance to experience that moment of appreciation from the whole theater again, I would jump at it.
684
I'd have to say the Pianist as well.
685
Not because I had a similar experience as you, but because I would watch it without knowing what was coming next.
686
I often find myself finding an excuse to leave the room when I know a particularly powerful scene is coming up Spoiler.
687
Because I try to skip scenes like that I tend to get less and less out of the movie now.
688
Terminator 2. I saw it at the drive in when I was 9.
689
It was epic.
690
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
691
Saw when I was 7. Also epic.
692
Great soundtrack too.
693
I still have the tape.
694
It's red.
695
Has not aged gracefully.
696
Neither has my tape deck.
697
Hard Candy, without a doubt.
698
I had no idea what to expect before the movie, so every single plot twist totally took me off guard.
699
I had just thought the pedophile was going to attack this innocent girl.
700
I've never before or since had a thriller take hold of me so strongly.
701
Dark Knight Rises.
702
I've read the comics, but somehow the twist caught me completely off guard.
703
Wish I could experience that again.
704
Sadly.Twilight.
705
When I first saw this I had no idea what it was about other than vampires, and this was even before every girl I know had read the series.
706
I had gone to see 'Let the Right One In,' but it had already started so we went to see the other vampire movie.
707
10 minutes in I said 'what the f--ck is this?'
708
After that I laughed and laughed at one of the worst movies I had ever seen.
709
Now everyone knows how bad they all are, but at the time it was great to be surprised by utter crap.
710
Rocky III
711
With most of my favorite movies, I enjoy just as much on repeat viewings.
712
Off the top of my head I'd probably go with The Departed though just because of the suspense factor as well as the last five minutes of the film.
713
The Wrestler
714
Pitch Black.
715
I really liked the entire movie, and still enjoy watching it in the dark.
716
This was also one of the first DVDs I ever owned and one I'll re-watch.
717
The characters are great, the concept and story are good, and I enjoy Vin Diesel's performance as Riddick, especially opposite Cole Hauser.
718
Safe to say Christopher Nolan owns your life.
719
The Prestige.
720
One of my personal favorite movies, but I didn't pay enough attention on my first time watching it.
721
Me and You and Everyone We Know.
722
I first saw it a little too young and came away with nothing.
723
It took a little more years under my belt to enjoy what the movie was really doing.
724
TDKR and TDK,
725
Equallibrium.
726
Made me realize other action films just didn't get it.
727
The Cider House Rules when spoiler
728
That's one hell of a trailer.can't
729
wait!
730
It's obvious, but nothing beats Back To The Future.
731
Ever since (500) Days of Summer, I've heard Sweet Disposition all over the place.
732
EDIT: In movie trailers, "Hysteria" by Muse is ridiculously overplayed
733
Not really movies or TV, but the old radio classics The Green Hornet and The Lone Ranger are together.The character of the Lone Ranger is the uncle of Britt Reid, aka the Green Hornet.
734
Star Trek and Doctor Who http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTrek:TheNextGeneration/DoctorWho:Assimilation2
735
Michael Fassbender and Emma Stone
736
Eye of the Tiger.
737
Borat and Ali G?
738
Clint Eastwood and Ingrid Bergman
739
I would love to be on set on ANY Christopher Nolan film.
740
The man is a genius.
741
All the sets he builds, the lengths he will go to get certain shots etc.
742
Just look at the zero gravity hotel fight scene in inception.
743
What a great man.
744
Shaun Of The Dead, it looked like so much fun to make.
745
The ending of Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father
746
Full metal jacket - The soap in socks scene.
747
Inglourious Basterds - Opening scene at the farm house Clockwork Orange - shock therapy
748
This is a classic over played song
749
Any Kubrick/Nolan/Burton/Scorsese/Tarantino movie
750
Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father
751
Any Zombie movie - let me be the first to "turn".
752
I wish I could have been a Ghostbuster or a caddy in Caddyshack.
753
Does porn count as a movie?
754
Godfather part 1
755
Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar)
756
In Darkness by Agnieszka Holland if you like WW II movies.
757
Up! - in the begining of the cartoon when story of Carl and his wife is shown in a couple of minutes scene.
758
/edit typos
759
I really like the parking lot fight scene in Brick.
760
Felt like a fairly realistic amateur fistfight.
761
Modern - Tom Hardy and Sarah Rafferty.
762
90's - Michael Ironside and Michelle Pfeiffer.
763
70's - Malcom McDowell and Louise Fletcher.
764
Overall, my pick would be a young McDowell and Fletcher.
765
The villainy would be too much for just one movie.
766
I watched it again last night, its still awesome.
767
The first time I saw it in 3D and it completely blew me away, and very few films can do that.
768
I liked watching it again as you can really appreciate the film rather than being sat there going "ohmygodohmygodohmygod!".
769
Also didn't see the scene in the Diner at the end the first time around.
770
Rambo, Expendables, and any Harry Potter
771
Depp/DiCaprio and McAdams/Portman.
772
Jeremy Renner and Anne Hathaway.
773
his movies are like jerking off 10 tens in one day their good at the start then they start getting boring and by the end you just want it to stop
774
Reservoir Dogs hands down
775
Also see Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.
776
Awesome car stunts!
777
Reign Over Me w/ Adam Sandler.
778
His outpouring of emotion at the end is unbelievable.
779
The Punisher movie w/ Thomas Jane had me feeling like I was the one being punched.
780
humans, clothes, hair, wet clothes, wet hair
781
Motion blur.
782
Especially in intense action scenes where the cameras move all over the place, there is always something off about the motion blur: either too much, or too little.
783
The most difficult effect I've seen in a film is still probably the last shot of Gollum in The Two Towers.
784
It's a good 2 min+ stedicam shot in a forest with a digital character, dialogue, and a ton of camera movement.
785
That must have taken an unbelievable amount of effort, planning, shooting, and post work.
786
It's probably why there has never been another shot like that in any movie yet.
787
A tree sloth and Kristen Bell.
788
Let hilarity ensue!
789
Daniel Day-Lewis and Cate Blanchett.
790
Top tier character acting.
791
Ed Norton and Uma Thurman
792
Bill Murray and Anne Hathaway!
793
Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone, they've got great chemistry and they could easily play brother/sister,boyfriend/girlfriend,friends or even enemies.
794
They'd be great in comedies.
795
I'd also like to have Chloe grace Moretz
796
Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.
797
Christian Bale and Kristen Belle, obviously http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POcuiqRTbnM
798
Daniel Day Lewis and Cate Blanchett
799
Sam Rockwell and Meryl Streep
800
Tom Hardy and Natalie Portman or JGL
801
Michelle Rodriguez and.
802
I'll have to get back to you on the other one.
803
Leo.
804
Hmm went for Viggo Mortensen first, then I thought of Gary Oldman.
805
Both serious actors although Viggo can be more versatile I reckon.
806
For actress Kristen Bell because she is awesome.
807
Ben Foster and Natalie Portman.
808
I think Leonardo Dicaprio.
809
Christian Bale and Allison Brie
810
Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, JGL, Meryl Streep.
811
MERYL STREEP.
812
Crispin Glover and Chloe Sevigny.
813
Natalie Portman and Tom Hanks.
814
Match made in heaven!
815
Well Godard and Karina is a better combination, or Herzog and Kinski or PTA and his regulars I think there's better examples than Tim Burton and Co.
816
I personally think Mary Elizabeth Winstead, has a lot of untapped potential.
817
I'm not too sure why, but I could see her playing the lead in a small indie film with a low key but powerful performance that gets her out of this Scream Queen rut she's in.
818
Also a big fan of Elizabeth Olsen.
819
I even think Miley Cyrus could pull off something unexpected.
820
Then there's my personal list of likes: Gillian Anderson, Molly Ringwald, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chloe Sveigny Male - Paul Dano is a great and underrated actor.
821
He seems to have been forgotten lately.
822
Crispin Glover, the same.
823
Robin Williams has fallen into ill-repute, despite great performances in things like World's Greatest Dad.
824
.I'm going to be like Altman or Welles and just have regulars I use a lot.
825
Chuck Norris.
826
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Daniel Day Lewis.
827
Viggo Mortensen.
828
Because reasons.
829
JGL and Cotillard
830
Nathan Fillion
831
Tom Hardy and Marion Cotillard.
832
natalie portman and my penis
833
Bruce Campbell and Simon Pegg.
834
Ed Norton, Natalie Portman
835
Even though I don't have anyone in mind atm, I would pick 2 actors that are better at being supporting characters rather than leads.
836
Who the hell wants to make films with the same lead again and again?
837
(other than Burton I guess)
838
To go along with the reptition of Oldman, Fassbender, Portman, Cotillard, and Blanchett, I nominate: Ewan McGregor
839
I'd fucking steal Johnny Depp and put him in good shit, like he used to be.
840
Michael Caine and Noomi Rapace.
841
Nick Cage and Kristen Stewart.
842
Paul Dano and Ellen Page
843
Tom Hardy and Melissa Leo.
844
if I were a famous director, hopefully I would have enough pull to make sure all of my actors were unknowns.
845
It is very rare that I can believe in an actor who I already know, and forget that it isn't them in a role.
846
So, reddit has a serious Natalie Portman fetish.
847
I'd go with Daniel Day Lewis and Audrey Hepburn.
848
You never said they had to be alive.
849
Michael Fassbender and Anne Hathaway
850
Robert Downey Jr and Natalie Portman
851
Scarlett Johansson.
852
Maybe that would increase my chances to hit dat.
853
jim carrey and adam sandler
854
The scene in 'Crash' when the little girl JUMPS IN FRONT OF HER DAD AND TAKES THE BULLET.
855
MY HEART STRINGS.
856
PULLED.
857
(yes we find out it's a blank after the reveal, but still)
858
'Back To The Future'.
859
I've watched it like 10 times, but every time it's on tv IM ON IT.
860
You can watch that movie over and over again.
861
Whatever's hot or 'in' at that moment.
862
Movies will usually reflect societies interests and fears at the time.
863
That's why there are so many superhero movies out at the moment, that's why vampires were in last year etc.
864
It's a good way to make $$$, make what people love.
865
I'm still in awe that the GOP is about to nominate a Massachusetts Governor who championed healthcare overhall to represent the masses of conservatives who are outraged over.
866
healthcare overhall.
867
It's unreal.
868
You're doing it to yourselves, Republicans.
869
Wut, this hasn't been said yet?
870
Terminator 2: the thumbs up.
871
Cried like a baby.
872
I am so ready to be disappointed by this movie.
873
Sarah Jessica Parker because I am a bit afraid of Horses
874
Kirsten Dunst.
875
Jason Statham.
876
Adam Sandler.
877
Maybe it's because he plays the same passive-aggressive character.
878
Not an actor but I despise Guy Fieri.
879
A co- workerFound found out and posted pics of him all over the office.
880
The guy makes me want to poke my own eyes out
881
Jessica Biel.
882
She's not bad and she's good at action but she's so.bland.
883
Hillary swank.
884
I have no idea why, I just hate her
885
Anne Fucking Hathaway
886
Ethan Hawke.
887
Fucking Ethan Hawke.
888
I hate his "I'm not a movie star, I'm an actor" persona, I hate his scruffy "I don't care about my appearance" face, I hate his pseudo-intellectual Richard Linklater all-talk-no-plot movies, I hate his fucking name.
889
Why won't he answer my letters!
890
ETHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
891
Julia Roberts for some reason.
892
James Franco.
893
Jamie Lee Curtis.
894
Can't stand her.
895
Liv Tyler.
896
Fucking Ben Affleck.
897
Denis Leary.
898
I dont know why but I just dont there is something about him I don't agree with.
899
Robin Williams.
900
He was only good as the voice of Genie and in Hook, but beyond that, hate him.
901
Russell Crowe, I think.
902
Sean Penn.
903
I just.
904
I don't know.
905
Bhargav Dronamraju as MA-TI, no one else can play him.
906
I dont remember the excact quote but it goes like this: "Please don't put that bag over my face.
907
I'm afraid of the dark.
908
I don't want to die in the dark".
909
Manly tears were shed at that moment.
910
Every song in Shrek.
911
(Including that karaoke-stuff in the bonus)
912
mostly, yes.
913
But in Elf i find him so charming, so empty-headed innocent, he IS Buddy the Elf.
914
Duh, Jingle All the Way.
915
An unsung classic.
916
"This is my ball!"
917
I saw both.
918
I didn't think either was amazing.
919
That's probably film heresy to say.
920
Just decent and kind of violent.
921
Pretty scary I guess.
922
I cried in the Phantom Menace trailer.
923
Funny, I had almost the same reaction after I saw the movie.
924
I would think one of the origins Star Wars movies, probably A New Hope.
925
It's old enough, it was translated in to a bazillion languages, popular everywhere, and at a time when films were pretty accessible to a large population.
926
Powerpuff Girls/Samurai Jack.
927
Pretty well known one.
928
I can't get the image at the moment, if someone wants to back me up.
929
Edit: I also just realized these are tv shows.
930
Damn it.
931
All the pixar movies are set in the same universe.They all have that pizza planet truck.
932
Jackie Brown and Out of Sight, both are movies set in Elmore Leonard's universe, bound by Michael Keaton's appearance as Ray Nicolette.
933
Han from The Fast and The Furious series is the same Han from Better Luck Tomorrow.
934
gi joe and transformers movie series from IMDB: "There isn't anything blatant, like General Hawk talking to Optimus or Megatron and the Decepticons aiding Cobra, but the novelization of G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra reveals that the nanomites used to destroy the Eifel Tower, create the Nano Warriors/Vipers, and give Zartan his morphing abilities, were actually developed by Sector Seven during their study of Megatron and the AllSpark (thus explaining why their heads resemble his), M.A.R.S. merely put them into mass production and marketed them worldwide.
935
Cobra Commander also uses these nanomites to build Destro's mask.
936
Originally, Brig.
937
General (at the time) Clayton "Hawk" Abernathy (still played by Dennis Quaid) was going to be in charge of NEST in this film, which would evolve into G.I. Joe once the Decepticon threat was eliminated, but this was changed in later drafts.
938
A second idea (which was inexplicably dropped right before principal photography began for this film) involved Major William "Wild Bill" Lennox talking to Gen. Hawk on the phone after the battle in Shanghai and Duke saying something along the lines of "At least they're not robots that turn into cars," when Heavy Duty shows him and Ripcord the very Iron Man-esque accelerator suits.
939
The fact that G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra shares its universe with the Transformers films creates what would at first glance appear to be a rather large problem: In the climax of this film, Devastator smashes the top of the Great Pyramid at Giza, so the Sun Harvester can convert Earth's sun into Energon to help further the Decpticons' conquest of the universe.
940
In The Rise of Cobra, all three pyramids are noticably intact.
941
However, this film takes place in 2009, while The Rise of Cobra takes place in 2019.
942
It is entirely possibly that the Great Pyramid was repaired during the ten years between the two, especially if the Autobots helped out.
943
As an aside, there are a suspiciously familiar black GMC Topkick (Ironhide's alt-mode), a Hummer H2 with a Search and Rescue paint job and equipment (Ratchet), and a silver Chevy Corvette Stingray (Sideswipe) in the background when Duke and Ripcord are first brought to the Pit, and the Joes have a fleet of the attack buggies Sector Seven used in Transformers (2007) sitting in one of their hangers.
944
These are only visible for a few seconds, but the camera lingers on them long enough to get the point across.
945
"
946
They're tv shows, but Friends and Mad About You.
947
Lisa Kudrow's characters on both shows were revealed to be identical twins.
948
Transporter and Collateral.
949
This is based on 1 minuscule fact that may me nothing, but Thomas Lennon played a doctor in both Memento and The Dark Knight Rises.
950
This means all of Nolan's movies take place in the same universe.
951
I don't know if this quite counts, but I like the universe in which both Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek take place.
952
The Matrix and the Terminator films.
953
The Grey is a prequel to Batman Begins.
954
Or at least I like to think so.
955
Star Wars and the Muppet Show.
956
Luke Skywalker did a guest spot back in the day
957
The Matrix, Terminator, Trasformers and Back to the Future movies are all in the same universe: Humans created Skynet and caused Judgement Day.
958
The humans fought against the robots for a while, but were eventually defeated.
959
Time travel technology had been around since the 1980s and was crucial in the robots campaign to crush the human resistance.
960
Once the resistance was defeated, the robots imprisoned the remainder of the human race and began growing humans to harvest as an energy source.
961
Eventually the robots upgraded beyond the need for human batteries, and allowed the last crop of humans to die.
962
The robots transformed the entire planet into a gigantic robo-scape, Cybertron.
963
Over time, the knowledge that Cybertron was once Earth was lost from the robots' memory.
964
When the robots left Cybertron in search of the Allspark they traveled back in time to Earth.
965
Sector 7, the government agency tasked with monitoring the Transformers, reverse-engineered the robots into the basis of all modern technology - including Doc Brown's flux capacitor and Skynet.
966
American Psycho, Less than Zero, Rules of Attraction.
967
I guess Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead are set in the same universe.
968
Maybe Paul is too?
969
Some people believe Alien and Blade Runner are the same what with all the Androids and off planet colonization.
970
So bear with me here, this gets messy.
971
Prometheus is set in both the Blade Runner and Alien universes.
972
Which also happens to be the Predator universe (Alien Vs.
973
Predator).
974
Which also happens to be the Batman universe (Batman Versus Predator).
975
From here we can either go through the existence of Ayatollah Khomeini in the Batman universe (he granted the Joker political immunity to get out of being punished for killing Jason Todd) to transition into our universe, or we could go through the route of the Punisher and Batman sharing a universe (Batman/Punisher: Lake of Fire), which opens two more avenues to us: The fact that the Punisher and Eminem (yes, the rapper) share a universe (Eminem and The Punisher) or the fact that the Punisher and Captain America share a universe (to my knowledge this has never happened in one specific crossover though) and Captain America and Barack Obama share a universe (Obama was the one to repeal the Superhuman Registration Act).
976
TL;DR: We live in quite the dangerous universe
977
ET and Star Wars.
978
Relevant /r/fantheories plug.
979
Relevant video, I guess.
980
Blade runner and alien.
981
Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, because the blue meth makes an appearance
982
American psycho - laws of attractions
983
Kevin Smith as a pretty large ensemble running through his first 5 films
984
I like to think The Rock (with Sean Connery) takes place in the Bond universe.
985
Sean Connery plays a British spy caught stealing secrets from the US Government in the 60's.
986
But that's just me.
987
If they'd get production started on Stephen king's Dark Tower film series, then literally half the Stephen King movies (like the books) would all be connected to those films.
988
Walking Dead and Breaking Bad.
989
Although this idea didn't sit well with TWD reddit.
990
I think that Rick, Lori, and the rest of the crew exist in the same world as Walter White, but they diverge into two realities.
991
One of which is the zombie world, the other is the BB world.
992
I'm going to take a risk and say it will be Pacifc Rim.
993
I grew up on old school monster movies, this is like a dream come true.
994
Gone Baby Gone when he finds the boy and kills the pedophile.
995
Nobody Knows (Dare mo Shiranai) The Thin Red Line Grave of the Fireflies Incidentally, these are three of my favourite films.
996
More likely they would expect 90% of humans have blue eyes.
997
Fun fact, in French (and some others) the title of the movie translates to "The Eighth Passenger".
998
Noun.
999
As in the creature.
1000
Fight Club, even the author thinks this.
1001
Also Big Fish.
1002
Lord of the Rings.
1003
All 3
1004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, by far my least favourite HP book and probably favourite movie.
1005
Great, watched the trailer and now I know the entire movie.
1006
Hey, at least it can't be worse than Paul Blart: Mall Cop
1007
This is definitely a Casper movieHere
1008
this was an exceptional film.
1009
and the only movie i've seen in 3D that actually looked good and was stunningly beautiful.
1010
Hellboy.
1011
Pan's Labyrinth.
1012
Although I can't stand to watch the scene with the bottle.
1013
Boring answer, but I think it's one of the best movies ever made.
1014
I like Cronos but it has to be Pan's Labyrinth.
1015
As a Director: Pans Labyrinth for sure.
1016
As a producer (EP): The Orphanage.
1017
I still think the guy is a hack
1018
Unbreakable 2.
1019
If he made a movie that didn't use a camera or actors or a script, and the twist was it was never a movie at all, it was just him quitting writing and directing.gasp
1020
:l
1021
How about a decent film?
1022
He unzips his mask and it was Tupac the whole time.
1023
Talent.
1024
Seems like the simple answer would be to pull his head out of his ass and make a good film again.
1025
Preferably one he didn't write.
1026
Death.
1027
The twist is that there isn't a twist!
1028
Less earlobe
1029
For everyone to get amnesia
1030
Put out a film that doesn't suck.
1031
Honestly, I think he has buried himself.
1032
He will forever be considered a joke in modern filmmaking.
1033
Sure he may do a good film, but he can't undo what has been done.
1034
For example: Nicky Cage.
1035
May have a handful of good films, still remembered for the goofy shit he has done.
1036
An ending that doesn't piss off everyone with a stupid sudden twist.
1037
Happy endings can exist too, Mr. Night.
1038
He could learn a thing or two from Nolan.
1039
I have a pretty simple reason for loving Raiders more than the others: Marion.
1040
She's like the Vesper of Indiana Jones.

You chose a giant, choppy gif to display this?
1045
I know I'm going to sound like an idiot, but what's TDKR?
1046
The rope didn't go to the top.
1047
The rope he was tied to was on a ring/pulley of some sort that had been attached somewhere midway up (below the jump).
1048
It only served the purpose of belaying someone from the ground so they wouldn't die if they failed the climb.
1049
So maybe you could argue he could get pulled up to one of the higher platforms but you'd still have to make the big jump yourself and climb the rest of the way.
1050
The rope at the top was a different rope.
1051
Why did he still have perfect physique after eating wafers for 5 months?
1052
Disgrace.
1053

1057
Ted Turner as Captain Planet.
1058
Ryan Reynolds as Captain PlanetNelsan Ellis as Kwame Slap some blonde hair on Jordan Levitt Gordon for Wheeler Olivia Munn can be Gi Any sexy blonde who's a decent actress can be Linka .and
1059
Christopher Walken should be Ma-Ti
1060
I think that there is a very special way that they could do this to make it perfect.
1061
* They create a live action "The Magic Schoolbus" film * Wait 10 years * Cast the children from the magic schoolbus as Captain Planet's team.
1062
* Success

huuge Face/Off fan here.
1079
Sir I hope you can stand subtitles (If you arent you are doing yourself a dis-service).
1080
I say this because I highly recommend you check out the director John Woo's epic Hong Kong action films.
1081
Before he brought his style over to America he was making shootemup classics such as Hard Boiled, The Killer, A Better Tomorrow and others.
1082
If you watch these you will notice a lot of trademarks that he uses, and he also used them in Face/Off.
1083
Trust me, the stories arent as crazy as Face/Off but the action is crazier!
1084
It's hard for me to choose between Bullhead (Belgium), Poetry (South Korea) and The Skin I Live In (Spain).
1085
All are outstanding movies and I'd definitely recommend them.
1086
Dno if this counts as foreign, but a badass movie nonetheless.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/

1105
Certainly not the most touching scene I've ever watched, but Little Shop of Horrors was on the other night and I had totally forgotten how sad "Somewhere That's Green" is.
1106
(youtube here).

Wladyslaw Szpilman is found in an abandoned house by a Nazi officer.
1122
He is then asked to prove his word, and perform a classical song.
1123
Here's the scene from The Pianist.
1124
Both of these scenes are so well directed (no surprise considering Terrance Malick and Roman Polanski are masters of course.)
1125
Also, music plays a large role, specifically Hans Zimmer's An Inconceivable Letter and Chopin's Ballade in G minor.
1126
Hal9000 singing "Daisy, Daisy" while David Bowman disconnects his cognitive circuits in 2001: A Space Odyssey.

1141
The scene in The Illusionist where they meet "officially" for the first time again (after the performance the crown prince attends and the Duchess "volunteers") and Eisenheim already knows who that woman is but she doesn't know yet who he is and he says "Maybe next time I'll make you disappear" and her face.
1142
so many feels
1143
This scene in Mulholland Drive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDeJwB4I9K0 Mhm touching.
1144
I agree with the security camera scene in Wall-E, however I think I preferred 'Define Dancing': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPW3mvAN0Rc

Good Will Hunting.
1152
Sean: Thought about what you said to me the other day, about my painting.
1153
Stayed up half the night thinking about it.
1154
Something occurred to me. fell into a deep peaceful sleep, and haven't thought about you since.
1155
Do you know what occurred to me? Will: No. Sean: You're just a kid, you don't have the faintest idea what you're talkin' about.
1156
Will: Why thank you.
1157
Sean: It's all right.
1158
You've never been out of Boston.
1159
Will: Nope.
1160
Sean: So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written.
1161
Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.
1162
Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right?
1163
But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
1164
You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling; seen that.
1165
If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites.
1166
You may have even been laid a few times.
1167
But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.
1168
You're a tough kid.
1169
And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, "once more unto the breach dear friends."
1170
But you've never been near one.
1171
You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help.
1172
I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet.
1173
But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable.
1174
Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you.
1175
Who could rescue you from the depths of hell.
1176
And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer.
1177
And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes, that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.
1178
You don't know about real loss, 'cause it only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself.
1179
And I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.
1180
And look at you.
1181
I don't see an intelligent, confident man.
1182
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.
1183
But you're a genius Will.
1184
No one denies that.
1185
No one could possibly understand the depths of you.
1186
But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine, and you ripped my fucking life apart.
1187
You're an orphan right?
1188
Sean: You think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist?
1189
Does that encapsulate you?
1190
Personally.
1191
I don't give a shit about all that, because you know what, I can't learn anything from you, I can't read in some fuckin' book.
1192
Unless you want to talk about you, who you are.
1193
Then I'm fascinated.
1194
I'm in.
1195
But you don't want to do that do you sport?
1196
You're terrified of what you might say.
1197
Your move, chief.
1198
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's final "Letter to his Daughter" scene.
1199
My feels are punched with emotion.
1200
Saving Private Ryan always gets me
1201
The scene at the end of A League of There Own when they all sing is so touching to me.
1202
I get so proud of everything they did and I tear up everytime.
1203
And in Step Mom at the last Christmas.
1204
This one is so incredibly bitter sweet.
1205
My sister and I watch it at least once a year.
1206
I don't think either of these movies will go down in history as great or profound movies but I love them so desperately.
1207
This scene in V for Vendetta http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etqte77XRRQ
1208

1209
Also, the music is incredible.
1210
Death of Littlefot's mother Oh my god :'( And of course the death of Mufasa At the age of 26, having watched these movies a number of times, I still choke back tears.
1211
The ending of the movie "Warrior."
1212
The ultimate culmination of Tom Hardy's character trying to do everything on his own, and it ends up getting him proper fucked.
1213
Having to watch his older brother try to protect his brother while also doing what is absolutely necessary for his family is heart-breaking.
1214
And the dad watching on the sidelines as he watches his two sons finally come back together while beating the absolute piss out of each other.
1215
Tears up.
1216
The scene in The Pursuit of Happyness when Will Smiths character tells his son "Dont let anybody tell you that you cant do something" cry like a baby every time.
1217
Ponyo.
1218
Just.
1219
Toy Story 3! It hits me right in the feels every time.
1220
My 3D glasses were fogging up.
1221
The Lion King: Simba walking up Pride Rock in the rain gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.
1222
There's a lot of touching moments in cinema, but the first one I remembered off the top of my head was this scene from Adam Sandler's "Click."
1223
The music absolutely makes it, and as he's lying on the ground in the pouring rain, watching his son leave for possibly the last time he'll ever see him, screaming as loud as he can and his son can't even hear him.
1224
Thinking back now, I can think of a lot more "touching" scenes in the movie such as this one, but this first scene is an absolute tearjerker, and I started to cry just watching it now as I posted it.
1225
This scene from Green Mile.
1226
By far the most challenging "don't-start-crying-while-there-are-others-in-the-room" experience ever.
1227
End of Children of Men, when the entire battle stops for just a moment to see the baby
1228

1230
The following contains a lot of movie destroying SPOILERS!
1231
BRAWWHHHH!
1232
(Howard Dean impersonation to scare people away) In "City of God" when what's his face makes the one little kid shoot the even littler kid.
1233
That was fucked up.
1234
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", when Kate Winslet is all like "But you're going to end up hating me, and I'll just end up bored with you" to which Jim Carrey replies "So?" and then it shows them running on the snowy beach a bunch of times.
1235
Got me teared up thinking about it.
1236
"Requiem for a Dream", the entire 3rd act, but especially when the mom is being visited in the mental hospital by her two friends, and as they leave they start weeping.
1237
There was definitely someone cutting onions in the room.
1238
"Irreversible" is definitely one of those fucked up and then by the end it almost has a beautiful sadness, because (unlike the main characters) I know the horrible events that are about to happen, but they're having a great time in a park with the sun shining and surrounded by joy.
1239
"Bad Santa" at the end where he gets the kid a purple elephant and gets shot trying to get it to him.
1240
"Cashback", at the end when he makes time go still with the chick he likes and they're kissing with all of the snow floating motionless around them.
1241

1242
The entire thing.

When he gets all fucked up by the bad guys because he thinks he has super powers, but he doesn't.
1246
Also at the end when he gives his monologue.
1247
"Man on Fire", where Denzel Washington gives his life so that the kidnapper will trade his brother's life for the life of Pita.
1248
"American History X" when Edward Furlong gets shot in the bathroom at the end and then it shows the beach and his dead disembodied voice reads his report.
1249
"A Scanner Darkly", at the end when we figure out that Keanu Reave was basically sacrificed with the hopes that once on the inside of where the police thought the little blue flower was being grown, that a couple unburnt neurons in his brain might fire and he could find a way to get the word out.
1250
Then when he picks one of the flowers and shoves it in his sock or pocket or wherever the hell he put it.
1251
Then when the names of all of the people who had their lives fucked because of drugs.
1252
Last two way mirror scene in Paris, Texas.
1253
A couple canine entries: White Fang when Ethan Hawke is leaving and he has to chase White Fang off into the woods.
1254
Nankyoku Monogatari (Antarctica), when the scientists return to find two of their dogs still alive.
1255
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvqnySNhQ0 'City of Lights' comes to mind it might be worth looking at a plot summary to make sense of this scene but basically the woman in this was blind until Charlie Chaplin's character helped get her eye surgery and set up a business.
1256
She had assumed he had been wealthy and so did not recognise him when she saw him on the street.
1257
Watch the scene.
1258

1259
Movie: "Dean Spanley" Please do not read any further if you have not seen this film.
1260
The death of the dog and the simultaneous reconcilliation with his son.
1261
It was the singlemost heartwrenching and warming scene in cinematic history for me.
1262
I had absolutely no idea it was coming.
1263
I watched it by myself while my wife was reading in the bedroom.
1264
I crumbled.
1265
Absolute uncontrollable sobbing.
1266
The last 15 minutes of that film is so deep and memorable that I cannot think of it without getting choked up.
1267
Never in my life has a film so touched me.
1268
Peter O'Toole should have won a fucking Oscar for that performance.
1269
The way he looks at his son in that moment levels me.
1270
Absolutely brilliant film.
1271
Top 5 of all time.
1272
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-47cwN0wc
1273

Everywhere.

1280
The old man can't talk and writes "Am Happy" on a chalkboard around his neck and Brad Pitt says "I'm Happy, too".
1281
It gets me every time.
1282
Thanksgiving dinner in "Pieces of April"
1283
Not a movie, but a miniseries.
1284
There are so many scenes in Band of Brothers that are so poignant and devastating.
1285
There's one scene in particular that never fails to get to me.
1286
The Breaking Point, the episode just after Bastogne where Easy Company is dug in their fox holes and enduring wave after wave of shelling by German artillery.
1287
When spoiler That feeling is the worst thing you can possibly imagine.
1288
Any semblance of rational thought is gone from your mind.
1289
You can only try to keep fighting to hold on, even though you know that in the end you can't win.
1290
You can't get up.
1291
Probably not the most touching I ever watched, but it is one I remember from recently watched: last harry potter movie, dance scene with Harry and Hermione - friend cheering up a friend.
1292
Only one scene has ever made me burst into tears.
1293
Like sobbing uncontrollably, blubbering like a baby, had to pause because I was crying so hard.
1294
This is the scene.
1295
Do not watch it unless you want your day ruined.
1296
You've been warned.
1297
It's difficult for me to not nominate the last scene of the Shawshank Redemption, and there are so many other great parts in that movie, but I think this part is right up there: The opera scene
1298
the last 5 minutes or so of the notebook
1299

Re-watched "Apollo 13" the other day.
1318
When they find out something went wrong with their ship, and the mom has to tell her son that something happened, and the kid asks "was it the door?" in reference to when Hanks was playing with his kid earlier in the film, I teared up.
1319
Powerful stuff.
1320
The opening to "UP"And the ending of "Homeward Bound"
1321
The first five minutes of UP, right in the feelings
1322
One that I can think of is the scene from "9" when the dolls are celebrating and listening to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", when the machine comes out of the mist and kills 9's good friend.
1323
The scene is silent except for the song, and it is very touching.
1324
The scene at the end where the dead dolls' souls are released and wave as they float up into the sky made me cry too.
1325
Saving private ryan the entire opening scene and when the medic gets hit and they are all trying to calm him down.

Damn.

Time.
1368
It's right at the moment when Kevin Costner's dad is just turning and walking back into the cornfield, and Costner, with his voice slightly breaking, asks his dad if he wants to play some catch.
1369
Say what you want about Costner, or even that film, but that one scene is probably the most awful heart-wrenching joy I've ever watched.
1370
K, mines a bit generic, but its the scene in Titanic where Kate says to Jack "I'll never let go" and he DIES.
1371
Come to think of it, the whole movies was kind of touching
1372
The scene in Ricky-Oh where Oscar pulls out his guts and says "Come Ricky.
1373
we'll die together."

Wow i just posted a similar question.
1377
Mine was the scene from 50/50 right before he goes into surgery.
1378
His voice and face when he feels like evrythings moving too quickly and he says "mom" just kills me
1379
Intro scene of Up - Carl and Ellie
1380
Looking at this thread, I think that there is an age and stage of life difference in how people are viewing what is touching.
1381
For example, I'm married man approaching (or in!) middle age and I'm still deeply in love with my wife.
1382
UP hit me in the gut.
1383
There is a theory that men and women have different emotional touchstones in movies.
1384
For men, it's things like relationships with their fathers, brotherhood, noble sacrifice and the martial virtues.
1385
Movies like Field of Dreams, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Brian's Song, Or Old Yeller, etc. Women love the dying mom genre (Step Mom is the platonic ideal) and the various chick-flick type of movies.
1386
Any of the Holocaust movies are almost inherently touching but can cross the line into emotional manipulation.
1387
Schinder's List is emotionally devastating without being manipulative.
1388
Life is Beautiful, OTOH.
1389
Dead dog movies are a special case (Old Yeller).
1390
But others are responses to highly manipulative film making.
1391
Titanic?
1392
Step Mom? Armageddon?
1393
Really?

You kids need to grow up.

It's used in commercials also, constantly.

Especially if it's a commercial about food flying about in slow-motion.

Over the Rainbow.
1403
I'm kind of glad I saw Human Centipede if that makes sense?
1404
It wasn't really graphically gross or explicit, it was just dark.
1405
I mean, maybe that's the reason I'm glad or something, but it was worth one (1) watch, just to see what all the fuss was about.
1406
As for my one unsee, Baby Geniuses 2 or those fucking God-awful Hoodwinked movies.

Rule Britannia.
1409
So many times when characters travel to Britain in a film, the chorus part of Rule Britannia is played (usually along with shots of the Houses of Parliament in London).

Superman Returns - Teaser.
1411
This is my all time favourite.
1412
The film may have been disappointing, but I think the teaser is just perfect.
1413
Just watched it now for the first time since the film came out, and still got goose bumps.
1414
I actually really like them both.
1415
However, I do prefer the CGI, in still pictures at least.
1416
In the film you didn't really get a GOOD look at mutated Fifield, so it worked well enough.
1417
Seeing these stills of him with the makeup, latex etc. he really isn't that menacing.
1418
If we count songs in trailers as well as in the movies themselves, my vote would be Filter's Hey Man Nice Shot.
1419
I feel like it was in every movie trailer for a long time, and I've seen it in plenty of movies as well, most recent one being I Melt With You (which otherwise has a really good soundtrack.)
1420
Oh, and Jim Carrey and Robin Williams both have so much range in their comedic roles.
1421
Any article that attempts to defend The Last Crusade without mentioning Tom Stoppard is useless.
1422
The only correct answer to this question is Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel.
1423
Wow, almost all of you are missing the premise of the question.
1424
What most films get wrong about fighting is how clumsy and desperate it is.
1425
Fists and legs do not connect to flesh as well as they do in any action film, ever.
1426
Here is a realistic fight scene.
1427
Notice how there is a deliberate absence of style, and how physically grueling it seems.
1428
This is what it must actually be like to fight someone.
1429
I doubt I could last twenty seconds.
1430
The problem with The Avengers is how you have to turn off your brain in order to enjoy it.
1431
AO Scott at the New York Times nails it.
1432
But for all their maverick swagger, the Avengers are dutiful corporate citizens, serving a conveniently vague set of principles.
1433
Are they serving private interests, big government, their own vanity, or what?
1434
It hardly matters, because the true guiding spirit of their movie is Loki, who promises to set the human race free from freedom and who can be counted on for a big show wherever he goes.
1435
In Germany he compels a crowd to kneel before him in mute, terrified awe, and “The Avengers,?
1436
which recently opened there to huge box office returns, expects a similarly submissive audience here at home.
1437
The price of entertainment is obedience.
1438
Joan Jett and the Blackhearts' "Bad Reputation".
1439
every third movie trailer uses that song.
1440
Also, in terms of movie trailers, you have to mention Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill", a song that was so overused it was used in one of the best movie trailer parodies of all time.
1441
Honestly I strongly believe the villain in a film makes or breaks it, and I just don't think that Walter Donovan stands up to these guys.
1442
You know what, I'm just gonna come out and say it: I didn't hate The Crystal Skull.
1443
There.
1444
It's at the bottom of my list for the series, but it's not that bad.
1445
I'll admit I could do without Shia (or however you spell it) and the CG monkeys could go.
1446
However, I've heard dissent over commies instead of nazis, the whole fridge thing, and of course aliens.
1447
As far as antagonists, the nazis were done at this point.
1448
Time to move on.
1449
(I still think nazis make great fodder, btw.)
1450
Regarding both the fridge and the aliens: suspension of disbelief.
1451
In a movie series with the ark of the covenant, magic and the holy grail, why are concepts like avoiding nuclear fallout in a lead-lined fridge and aliens such a stretch?
1452
The best thing about that article was the author's bio: Emily Asher-Perrin saw The Last Crusade when she was 3 years old, and tried to explain the whole plot to her godmother.
1453
while the poor woman was being driven to the hospital to give birth.
1454
He forgot the best quote from 'Last Crusade'.
1455
"He has chosen.
1456
poorly."
1457
I'm always happy when I see that I'm not alone in my belief that the Last Crusade is the best Indy film.
1458
I love Raiders, though, don't get me wrong, I just think that Crusade just narrowly edges it out.
1459
I'd also like to mention that I think the climax fight scene spoiler remains one of the best action scenes in movie history.
1460
I think it's amazing just how well that whole scene is put together.
1461
So much feels at stake, and at the same time, Indy is just getting his ass kicked, which makes his continued determination to win so much sweeter.
1462
I was entertained and also disappointed with Last Crusade.
1463
As a pre-teen in the theater I remember this was one of the first times I ever felt that the just because it was a high budget, big release movie doesn't mean it's infallible.
1464
It felt like Jedi - very "safe".
1465
Entertaining but no where near as good as Raiders.
1466
Way too contrived at the end.
1467
I'm not looking for ultra realism in an Indiana Jones story, but they somehow get from a blimp in Germany to the exact spot where they can rescue and meet up with both Marcus and Sallah and then it's just a skip and a jump to the grail site.
1468
The first 90 minutes of the movie was a mystery to solve and then bammo, they wrap it all up in a couple of action scenes and fast forward to the grail cave.
1469
All that being said, Last Crusade is a great movie compared to the vast majority of other big budget films out there, and vastly superior to Indy 4. Much like how Jedi is IMHO the weakest of the first 3 Star Wars movies but still vastly better than any of the prequels.
1470
I just don't think Last Crusade is the best Indy movie.
1471
I prefer Raiders, but I won't argue with somebody saying it's Last Crusade, as long as everyone agrees it's between those two.
1472
If somebody started trying to argue that Temple of Doom was the best, or that Crystal Skull was anything other than a pile of crap, then I'll have issues.
1473
Two words: No ticket.
1474
There will never be a day when I cant sit back and re watch any origonal Indy movie.
1475
Movie gold.
1476
Wrong.
1477
Character assassination for the sake of comdey.
1478
Characters, like Brody, changing from scholars to morons, and heavy-handed comedic bickering and buffoonary b/w Indy and his father.
1479
Enjoyable despite these, but second-rate to Raiders.
1480
Last Crusade is my favorite as well.
1481
As far as I care there's only two Indy movies and they stand on on equal footing.
1482
Temple wasn't great, it felt like parts of a movie squished together.
1483
The Crystal Skull, it goes without saying.
1484
Although I could be persuaded to give Skull another look with a different ending.
1485
I've been a huge fan of these movies for years.
1486
I am, however, tired of hearing that Last Crusade is "the best."
1487
Without Raiders, Last Crusade would have no precedent to follow.
1488
Here's the ultimate litmus test.
1489
which movie am I describing?
1490
"Join Indiana Jones, and an estranged figure from his past, in a race against time to locate a powerful Christian artifact before it falls into the evil hands of the nazis!"
1491
If the sequel's plot can be summed up EXACTLY the same as the original film, then you've got a story problem.
1492
I think that for most people, the excellent chemistry between Ford and Connery blinds them to the otherwise rehashed plot.
1493
Shoot, the beginning of the film is an almost shot for shot recreation of Raiders.
1494
Indy finds something, then loses it in a dramatic fashion.
1495
He makes his escape, and then we cut to a shot of the College, and then to Jones teaching.
1496
I don't care at all if someone wants to call Crusade their favorite.
1497
People are entitled to their likes and dislikes, as I am sure my dissenting opinion will earn me most of thee dislikes in the form of a blue arrow.
1498
Don't take this the wrong way, I do enjoy Last Crusade, but for what it is, it's far from my favorite.
1499
Temple of Doom is my favorite, not just because it's different, or I want to be some movie hipster or whatever.
1500
I love Temple of Doom because it puts Jones in a wholly different set of circumstances in a different area of the planet.
1501
Without reading any of the novels or extended universe stuff about him, Temple of Doom gives Jones the "globe trotting" personality that is assumed of him.
1502
We have a macguffin that's not Judeo-Christian, we have a great bad guy with the Thuggee cult.
1503
Child abusers?
1504
Yeah, those are guys we love to hate.
1505
We have the standard, crazy, unbelievable bullshit that we've come to expect from a Jones film (raft sequence, sacrifice), and Indy's interactions with Short Round show a broader, warmer side to his character, and the fact that he gives the stone away at the end of the movie shows that Jones isn't all about the "fortune and glory" as he seems like he is in the other two.
1506
"The museum gets the ark when we're done, right?" "THAT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!" Jones gave the rock away because it was the right thing to do for the villagers, despite originally being about "fortune and glory" in the second act.
1507
Raiders has a couple of comedic moments (the Cairo swordsman, Marion taking out a hitman with a frying pan), as does Temple (the feast, reaching for his gun and finding the holster empty).
1508
Crusade, however, seems to have more "WAY-OH!"
1509
moments than the other two (pen is mightier than the sword, fireplace and Castle Bruenwald banter, the marketplace scene with Marcus, the pigeons, the Messerschmidt pilot seemingly intentionally crashing his plane and the looks on everyone's faces, What about the boat?
1510
I could go on.).
1511
Speaking of Marcus.in
1512
Raiders, Marcus is obviously a trusted friend and colleague, someone whom Indy respects and and admires.
1513
Sallah is Indy's very good friend on which he can rely, and is "the best digger I know."
1514
So good that Indy "knew the Germans would hire him."
1515
In Crusade, Marcus is a bumbling idiot that would get "lost in his own museum," and Indy must think Sallah is an incompetent boob.
1516
"I said NO camels, that's FIVE camels, can't you count!" Sallah leads Brody right into the clutches of the Nazis, and Marcus can't even handle himself in the marketplace, being accosted by everyone there until Sallah shows up.
1517
Hell, he doesn't even get the fucking hint when Sallah is saying: "ha ha, run."
1518
"Whaa?" "Papers, got it here.
1519
Just finished reading it, myself!
1520
RUN." "Yes."
1521
(proceeds to do fuck all) "Egyptian Mail, morning edition!
1522
RUN!" Despite all this, yes, I do like Last Crusade.
1523
Beat all other Indy films?
1524
Yeah .
1525
no.
1526
No, it doesn't.
1527
I rank CRUSADE as the only other Indy film worth a hot damn with a great soundtrack, some nifty series-worthy action sequences and workable back-to-basics-Nazi-fighting plot but it just doesn't match how well those things came together in the original.
1528
I could go through a list of now iconic moments from RAIDERS that stand apart from CRUSADE that has almost none by comparison.
1529
I'm not talking about among we "Indy fans," I'm talking about the general movie-going public.
1530
But here's a very simple one that contains a bit of spontaneity that is absent from every other film in the series: Jones giving a weary groan and shooting the Arab swordsman (as everyone here must know, it was improve made on the set).
1531
Just as the audience expects, the shooting script had a whip vs sword fight.
1532
But Jones cuts the Gordian Knot with his pistol to continue his chase of Marion.
1533
It produces one of biggest surprise laughs of any film around.
1534
But mostly CRUSADE doesn't have the combination of memorable characters.
1535
Does anyone honestly think Elsa, Donovan, Vogel compare to Marion, Belloq, Toht?
1536
Plus the non-sitcom versions of Brody and Sallah.
1537
Granted, Connery created a very distinct character we believe capable of being The father of Indiana Jones, which only highlights how much the other new characters come off as simply stock.
1538
But RAIDERS has as a subplot the re-blossomed romance between Jones and Marion that made a generation fall in love with either Ford or Karen Allen.
1539
CRUSADE also comes across too much like the very thing it was: a studio-made picture.
1540
Too many times the artifice of either the sets (esp.
1541
the exploding ship in the beginning) or the effects break the suspension of disbelief (the plane vs car chase with seagulls is a glaring example, same for the tank over the cliff).
1542
RAIDERS ends with one of the most iconic ORIGINAL images from the movies: the crate being wheeled into a humongous warehouse.
1543
That image is made more spectacular from the knowledge that outside of the worker, ark crate on cart and floor the entire rest of what the viewer is seeing is hand-done matte painting.
1544
IRCC no other matte painting has stayed on screen as long as that one does.
1545
RAIDERS is viewable on it's own, whereas the other films depend upon each other and it for much of the humor.
1546
Everything in RAIDERS feels fresh, new on some level even while being an exercise in nostalgia for both culture (cliffhanger serials) and history (when geopolitics could be reduced to "US good, Nazis bad").
1547
For me, I guess I also benefit from actually being around when RAIDERS came out in a Indiana Jones-free world.
1548
It did not have the built-in recognition the others' could rely on - it had to sink or swim (jump/fight/fly) on it's own.
1549
Jones could be talking about the film itself when he says "I don't know.
1550
I'm making this up as a go along."
1551
I think the ending to Raiders of the Lost Ark is misunderstood (by most people), and this is why I think it makes for the greatest of all 'adventure movie' endings: After everything that happens in the movie, all the fights and escapes, etc, Indy GIVES UP.
1552
He sitting on the hill with the bazooka pointed at the ark and says he will blow it up if Belloq doesn't give him Marion.
1553
Belloq calls his bluff and says "Go Ahead Indy, blow it up.
1554
Blow it back to God.
1555
You know you want to see whats in it as much as I do.".
1556
Indy puts down th Bazooka and gives in to his own desire.
1557
BUT. at somepoint Indy realizes his folly, so when he and Marion are tied to the post he tells her "don't look at it".
1558
Basically realizes, the power of the ark is not meant to see.
1559
So in the end, God, not indy, kills everyone, and just kind of gives Indy and Marion a pass on dying because of their penitence, humbleness, restraint, or whatever.
1560
As much as the rest of the movie harks back to 'old' adventure movies, this is a very deep sort of ending that took a while for me to really get.
1561
I'd rank Raiders and Temple of Doom above Last Crusade, even though I still think Last Crusade is amazing.
1562
Raiders' storyline is more romantic and epic in scale, whereas Last Crusade was more personal.
1563
I even prefer the desolate, foreign feeling of Temple of Doom, which is almost a flat-out horror film in parts.
1564
Both Raiders and Temple of Doom have better action and comedic elements than Last Crusade as well.
1565
Last Crusade almost solely relies on Sean Connery, who is awesome in the film, but there's hardly any other characters that stand out to me.
1566
Marion, Belloq and Short Round are much more enjoyable characters than any of the other supporting characters in Last Crusade.
1567
Even Kate Capshaw's character is more memorable than whoever was in Last Crusade (I can't even remember).
1568
Last Crusade isn't bad at all, in fact, it's an awesome movie.
1569
I just prefer the first two before it.
1570
And then Crystal Skull is, well, Crystal Skull.
1571
Because you were a child when it came out
1572
I don't even have to read the article.
1573
I completely agree.
1574
You know why? 3 words: Sean FUCKING Connery.
1575
Well it's apples and oranges, I mean Last Crusade is a big budget studio picture, not an indy.
1576
I've always loved Last Crusade the most.
1577
I remember watching it when I was 6 or 7 years old and being absolutely mesmerized by it.
1578
That opening/transition of Indy was one of the coolest things I had seen in movies at the time.
1579
I'm glad its coolness hasn't faded through the years.
1580
I love the three movies the same amount.
1581
And I allways thought that the character Indiana Jones should be approached exactly like the James Bond character.
1582
Change the actor when one gets too old and keep doing more movies.
1583
Hell yeah!
1584
Young Indy and Sean Connery FTW.
1585
I thought it was going to say "Sean Connery".
1586
"Don't call me junior!"
1587
Oh man, an Indiana Jones discussion, boy oh boy!
1588
I don't think it's possible to say that one movie was 'better' than the other when they're all so great.
1589
I personally like Raiders a lot more than the others, but then again, I don't hate on Crystal Skull like everyone else (apart from the monkeys.
1590
damn those monkeys).
1591
I didn't like Last Crusade's plot all that much, or at least not the conclusion to it, but the funny moments and chemistry between the characters made it for me.
1592
Temple of Doom had, perhaps, the best plot, but lacked what made the other two so great.
1593
Crystal Skull did, I think, a good job on importing an old recipe into a new age.
1594
It had its mistakes and mishaps, but as did the other films, and frankly - I enjoyed it tremendously (especially when Harrison denies Shia right at the end, with the hat.)
1595
The Last Crusade was always my least favorite of the original trilogy.
1596
Indy films always had a sense of humor but I felt TLC bordered on campy.
1597
Don't get me wrong, I still loved it, but I felt it didn't take itself quite seriously enough.
1598
I was about 8 years old when Last Crusade hit the theaters and it's the first or one of the first movies I remember seeing in the theater with my parents that I remember details of and thoroughly enjoyed.
1599
I'm sure that's a big part of it being my favorite of the series but I think this article really does a much better job than I ever could explaining why I enjoyed it more than the others.
1600
Eh, people can have different opinions.
1601
It doesn't make them wrong.
1602
I didn't really care for IJ:LC but I'd sure as fuck rather watch that over Crystal Skull any day.
1603
It's very rare for me to walk out of a movie but considering I watched it for free I had no qualms leaving.
1604
Last Crusade was always my favorite growing up.
1605
Now that I'm older I have a better appreciation for Raiders.
1606
Temple of Doom I never did really like, and still don't.
1607
It just doesn't fit with the other IMO.
1608
To me, Indy should be fighting Nazi's while doing his archaeology thing.
1609
I love that formula.
1610
I've noticed a real split depending on age.
1611
I saw Raiders first as a kid and I think I caught Temple a few years later when my parents rented it but they didn't like it much so we never bought a copy like we did with Raiders.
1612
That alone probably tints my impressions of the first two movies.
1613
Crusade is the only one I saw during its original theater run as I was in middle school by then.
1614
Anyway, I know that a lot of my younger friends saw Crusade first when it hit TV or video or whatever and then later on saw the older two films.
1615
Almost all of my friends who are my age or older like Raiders best whereas the friends who are maybe 5 or more years younger than me prefer the more modern and "shiny" Crusade.
1616
No doubt there are exceptions and at least it's almost always a debate between those two films and not any of the others.
1617
Wait, most people feel raiders is the better film?
1618
I always thought it was obviously Last Crusade.
1619
The first paragraph of this article is saying the equivalent of, "I'm going to get downvoted for this, but."
1620
My favorite is probably Raiders, but Last Crusade is a very close second.
1621
While Temple of Doom is clearly #3 for me, I actually liked that one a lot too.
1622
It has a different style than the others, but definitely has its moments, characters (Short Round), and great lines.
1623
I don't consider Crystal Skull an Indy movie, just like I don't consider the three newer Star Wars movies Star Wars movies.
1624
I find it pretty funny that I was literally just upstairs with my family telling them that The Last Crusade was my favorite Indy movie.
1625
Fate of Atlantis was my favorite.
1626
Oh man, an Indiana Jones discussion, boy oh boy.
1627
Of course it is.
1628
Was there any doubt about it?
1629
You chose.wisely
1630
While I like the Last Crusade, I don't like how they turned Sallah and Brody into buffoons.
1631
And, to me, it just isn't as exciting as Raiders.
1632
I respectfully disagree.
1633
Like most I still rank them Radiers then LC then Temple then Skull.
1634
This is intolerable!
1635
Totally agree!
1636
There's something the article writer forgot to mention.
1637
The sense of mystical awe that The Last crusade had.
1638
Altho I agree with some of you that they dumbed some of the characters for the sake of comedy (Sallah and Marcus, to be specific), what was important for me was the taste of spirituality that the movie had.
1639
Not only were we looking for probably the most precious artifact that mankind has ever heard of; There's a race against evil for this.
1640
This time it's not a "weapon", but the ultimate item of power (something like the Lance of Longinus that the Church boasted about giving them military victories, but even more transcendent).
1641
Furthermore, along with the music and The Grail Diary, this story is unforgettable.
1642
I remember that when I played the game, it came with a copy of the Grail Diary, so that you could study the clues to choose wisely at the end of the game.
1643
The ending was fulfilling, too.
1644
Instead of leaving it as a "mystery to be continued (maybe)" like they did with the first film, leaving the artifact in the hands of the military, we have a grail that was practically returned to its origin.
1645
The third party involved (the knights sworn to protect the grail) was also a nice touch.
1646
I suddenly remembered my Charmelenge, may my armys be the rocks and the trees, and the birds in the sky.
1647
Millennals are destroying the fucking world.
1648
That is all.
1649
would you rather be indiana or hon?
1650
Because crusade is the one I remember seeing in the theater when it came out.
1651
Thank you!
1652
I've gotten so much crap for choosing Last Crusade over Raiders for YEARS, glad that this opinion made it to the frontpage!
1653
You should of mailed it to the Marxsh brothers!
1654
If I can fit that into a conversation at least once a year I'm happy For some reason the boat chase in crusade never sat right with me.
1655
It was like there was no threat and really terrible editing.
1656
Beats All Other Indy Films You sly dog you
1657
My dad is a HUGE Indy fan and we both agree on this.
1658
However, when the Crystal Skull came out he was so excited, then immediately let down so so hard. he acted like a lost puppy for a week, it was brutal.
1659
I hear ya man, totally agree.
1660
I was like "Wait The Last Crusade wasn't an Indie film."
1661
then "DOH".
1662
I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne
1663
So we often like first films the best.
1664
If you did a general census and had fans checking boxes, most of them would tick Raiders, Back to the Future I, the first Matrix film, and so on.
1665
But just because those movies are essential to our understanding and enjoyment of further installments doesn't automatically make them the best.
1666
Why would you ever cite the Matrix in this context?
1667
"Bad Dates" is useful at parties if someone passes out.
1668
Not to mention the scene where Indy gets Hitler's autograph in his father's grail journal, that was comic gold
1669
The only movie I watched in the last 8 years.
1670
Excellent.
1671

122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.

122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
1675
122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
1676
122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
1677
122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
1678
122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
1679
I watched Idiocracy, too.
1680
God has a word for IQ/evolution obsessed people.
1681
"Vain" God says.
1682
the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
1683
34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 34:5 But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.
1684
34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 34:7 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
1685
Hated TOD when it came out (I was 13), but now I think it's the best one.
1686
Eh, maybe like wine, it aged well.
1687
It's my favourite one, but it has its drawbacks.
1688
Sallah and Brody just become silly, generally useless comic relief characters, far from how they were portrayed in the first film.
1689
Brody was more of a father figure, and seemed pretty careful, and competent, even in the few minutes we saw him, and Sallah was a really dependable man, just larger than life, and seemed to be the most helpful character in the film at times.
1690
In Crusade, the first thing he does is accidentally take Brody into a German truck, which then drives away.
1691
Just my opinion, really.
1692
It is my favourite movie of the THREE (there were only three, no more).
1693
Out of 100, I'd have to give it a 98, just above Raider's 97.
1694
That's how close they are.
1695
I seriously had no idea this was even up for debate.
1696
Any Indy film is a great film but everyone I grew up with adored Last Crusade.
1697
I really enjoyed The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, or whatever that show was called.
1698
Sure it was a bit of forest gumpesque always at the focal point of historic moments, but it did give me my fix of indy after the Last Crusade.
1699
Although, It was 20 years or so ago and I haven't seen them since, so they may suck.
1700
The real reason Last Crusades is the best: Alison Doody
1701
Crusade is ok if all you need is the roller-coaster and comedic aspects of the Jones films.
1702
The film is certainly fun, but it's largely fun at the expense of story, emotional depth and characterization.
1703
In Raiders, Jones felt more natural and mortal, the world and the Nazis felt 'slightly' more grounded in reality and a result more threatening.
1704
The differences aren't night and day, but by the end of the film they've compounded into changing the tone quite a bit, imo.
1705
Also need to take into account the context in which the films were made.
1706
Crusade very much rehashes a lot of the story elements, motifs and character motives that Raiders has, so it rarely feels like it's covering new ground or taking us somewhere new.
1707
None of the characters possess any sort of character arc aside from Indiana, and his is really never that solid to begin with.
1708
His motive throughout the film is very much to save his father, and yet they throw in a greed/redemption theme at the last minute to make it feel like the character has grown somehow.
1709
In reality, they've already dealt with that 'fortune and glory' theme in both previous films and this is simply retreading the same thing for the sake of a father-son moment.
1710
Did anyone read the City of the Gods script?
1711
I thought Crystal Skull might have been better received if they went with that version of the script.
1712
I think there was also something about the lost city of Atlantis in another script.
1713
I hope they make another one and its awesome so I don't have to talk anymore about the shortcomings of Crystal Skull
1714
Question: While we are on the topic of the Last Crusade, does Dr. Schneider give Donovan the wrong grail on purpose?
1715
It was clear she didn't stand for Nazi Germany, would she have handed over the Grail to Hitler? and Raiders is still better.
1716
The scene when Indy takes the truck with the Ark is the best action sequence in the Series.
1717
Indianapolis Jones sucks that's why!
1718
Playing in 70mm this weekend at the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz in Austin, TX
1719
pretty good argument.
1720
but at least we all can agree that this is one of the best trilogies of all time.
1721
trilogy.
1722
That feel you get after watching this movie.
1723
It's nothing like the other ones.
1724
Plus the whole father son relationship.
1725
It's also alot more comical than the other ones imo.
1726
The Last Crusade was actually the first Indy movie I ever saw.
1727
After seeing it was a little disappointed when I saw Raiders but I still liked it.
1728
The first time I watched Temple of Doom I thought it was a tv special.
1729
Like the Star Wars holiday special.
1730
I thought it was incredibly weak in comparison.
1731
And that's it.
1732
There are only three Indiana Jones movies.
1733
Only three.
1734
only three.
1735
Upvote for knowing what Children of Men is.
1736
I agree though.
1737
I think it would be more powerful to hear the guys doing the shooting shouting incoherently in the back and hearing gunshots in the background.
1738
It would put the viewer in Theo's shoes, wondering if Michael Caine survived or not
1739
Way of the Gun.
1740
The tactics in the movie are great but the part where they punch Sarah Silverman in the face and then get their asses kicked is pretty realistic.
1741
and awesome.
1742
I'd kick Maggie Gylenhal's ass out of Dark Knight.
1743
Spoiler Put Katie Holmes back in at least.
1744
It was a good popcorn cinema.
1745
Very enjoyable, but that's it.
1746
Saying that it's "a monumental achievement for film making" is probably the biggest hyperbole I've ever read.
1747
Also, I kind of facepalmed really hard when Stark pushed the propeller.
1748
Scott Pilgrim vs.
1749
The World.
1750
When I was in high school, back in the 80's, I was going through the typical high school I'm-so-depressed phase.
1751
My parents both worked and I was a latch key kid, I had about 2+ hours every day before my parents came home.
1752
I spent my entire Sophomore year, and the very beginning of my Junior year, coming home and watching Allen Parker's Pink Floyd-The Wall movie.
1753
Single.
1754
Day.
1755
When I finally outgrew that phase, I figured I had watched that movie at least 300 times.
1756
Maybe more.
1757
Wait, Cate Blanchett is in Hot Fuzz?
1758
last scene of Manon of the spring
1759
Buddy the Elf vs. Frank the Tank?
1760
No, he doesnt have an incredibly large range, but its there
1761
Most of Pan's Labrynth is like that for me.
1762
It is a very emotional film from beginning to end.
1763
The scene where he has a mental breakdown in 50/50.
1764
The opening from Up.
1765
Iron Giant, final scene
1766
Donnie Darko laughing at the end knowing he is going to die.
1767
just to save the girl who has yet to meet him.
1768
Final scene in The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1769
What Dreams May Come -- The ending where he starts to forget
1770
the end of requiem for a dream, makes me cry to no end and yet so.i don't even know
1771
Sidewalk scene in "American History X"
1772
JGL again in the expectations vs reality scene in (500) Days of Summer.
1773
The end of Children of Men Pretty much any King Kong movie when the ape falls to his death
1774
Oskar Schindler gets in the car.
1775
The scene from Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close where Oskar tells the old man his "story".
1776
When I first saw it, I was sobbing, but I couldn't stop replaying it.
1777
Yeah the part right before surgery had me in tears.
1778
I thought it was suck a well done movie; had its funny and sad parts, ad Seth Rogan was good in it as well.
1779
Sad they didn't get any mention at awards.
1780
In Amelie at the end when she's making the plum cake and she imagines Nino going down from her apartment to buy some ingredients then comes back up to play a trick on her with the curtains.
1781
She turns around and it's just the cat.then she starts sobbing.
1782
Right in the feels.
1783
The Bridge sequence at the end of Man on Fire was one of the most brutal scenes to watch
1784
Every scene in Meet the Parents.
1785
But for completely different reasons than you are probably looking for.
1786
The Green Mile.
1787
The final scene.
1788
Gets me every time.
1789
The scene in the cemetery in Steel Magnolias.
1790
Every time.
1791
There's a scene in Rugrats in Paris where the babies and parents are at a mother son dance or something and Chuckie doesn't have a mommy to dance with.
1792
I cried when I was seven when I first watched it and I still do now.
1793
The Pokemon movie when Ash turns to stone and Pikachu is devastated.
1794
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2RpuAGflSU&feature=related Tearing up as I type.
1795
Easily the ending of The Mist.
1796
You rationalize his decision and then get crushed by the reveal.
1797
It doesn't get much more emotional than that.
1798
"What's in the box!"
1799
Pretty much the whole movie of Brian Song.
1800
If you don't cry during that, you don't have a soul.
1801
Marley and Me, the ending hits home for me every time I watch it.
1802
So many scenes from Friday Night Lights.
1803
The one that got me though is when Boobie and his uncle have a good cry session when they find out he'll never play football again.
1804
The gut-punching end of Old Boy comes to mind
1805
There is a scene in House IV that has become a classic between me and my sister, in which a character has a sort of mucussy puss that's just been pumped from the lungs of some disgusting creature in a wheelchair poured down his throat as he's held down by thugs.
1806
Oh, GAWD.
1807
Rorschachs death in watchmen always brings me to a tear
1808
Final fight scene from Warrior.
1809
I cried native american tears
1810
Once We Were Warriors Alot of brutal scenes, I mean alot.
1811
Temuera Morrison (Jango/Boba Fett) is just so filled with rage all the time - then when he hears who raped his daughter.
1812
A scene that always gets me is the final shot in The Graduate.
1813
Ben drives all around California looking for a girl he spent a couple of nights with, finds her, breaks into a church, ruins a wedding, and takes the bride for himself.
1814
When I first saw it I was bouncing off the walls.
1815
but the final scene is so raw.
1816
I was living in my own fantasy world when in reality Ben was just some love-crazed boy stupid enough to be hung on a girl who he barely knew.
1817
I guess I was unsatisfied with the realistic ending (and maybe still am?) but I still thank Mike Nichols for avoiding cliche (in 1967!) and making one of the most memorable endings in cinema history.
1818
In Terms of Endearment with Shirley MacLaine at the hospital shouting, "Give my daughter the shot!"
1819
In To Kill A Mockingbird the courtroom scene.
1820
It was at that moment for me that I realized how much I hate racism.(not
1821
that I didn't hate it before but jeeze that movie gets to me)
1822
The scene where The Narrator destroys Angel Face.
1823
The entire movie "Synecdoche New York"
1824
The ending of It's a Wonderful Life.
1825
The only movie i've ever cried at so far.
1826
The scene in Pineapple Express, where James Franco eats his cheeseburger alone, on a swing no less, while a Chubby Mexican girl watches him from afar.
1827
so many of these go deep in linger long after the movie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SS3E1HP24&feature=related
1828
The knife fight scene in saving private ryan.
1829
God damnit Upham, go save him!
1830
I really wish 50/50 didn't show the outcome of the surgery.
1831
I really, really fucking hated the ending of that movie.
1832
So trite and forced.
1833
The approved cerebral answer is Primer.
1834
But I'm not going to karma whore.
1835
I love the first two Back to the Future movies.
1836
Absolutely love them.
1837
They're brilliant, funny and exciting.
1838
I've even got the soundtrack going through my head while I type this.
1839
If you didn't know, Michael J. Fox was not the original actor for Marty.
1840
It was Eric Stoltz.
1841
Also, the actor who played Biff Tannen carries around a FAQ card.
1842
I really enjoyed Timecrimes.
1843
Time Bandits
1844
not so much a cliche, but a trend.
1845
Movie trailers giving away the entire story arch.
1846
Ugh.
1847
I LIKE SURPRISES.
1848
I Feel Good by James Brown.All Star by Smash Mouth These can mostly be found in family movies.
1849
I would say How Do You Like Me Now by The Heavy was majorly overplayed over the last couple of years.
1850
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOORLET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRR .we're
1851
including amateur filmmakers right?
1852

But how the hell am I supposed to know that the teenagers are on a road trip if "Back in Black" doesn't play?
1855
Gimme Shelter.
1856
Not exactly so much in movies as much as their trailers, but E.S. Posthumous - Unstoppable.
1857
(Skip to 2:00) It's a great song, don't get me wrong, but I can't help but laugh every time I hear it when I'm at the theater.
1858
Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley's or Rufus Wainwright's version.
1859
It's an amazing song, but I've almost come to expect it when ever any character dies in any movie.
1860
Don't stop believing by journey.
1861
Its a good song but ever sincethe sopranos used it,its been played in every single movie that came out after.
1862
Born to be Wild by Steppenwolf.
1863
The second I hear "DONT GIVE A DAMN BOUT MY BAD REPUTATION" in any movie I cringe until the scene is over.

Another one that's in trailers rather than movies is Mr. Blue Sky by ELO EDIT: Added link

I think it has been played at every movie wedding.
1883
And every wedding in real life so it's like we're double sick of it.
1884
I can't believe no one has said Claire de Lune.
1885
Just last night I was watching an episode of Wilfred and the song was featured at the season finale.
1886
It's also in Oceans 11 and 13, Seven Years in Tibet, Atonement, Man on Fire, Darjeeling Limited and many many others.
1887
Great song though, I can't blame them for using this song alot.
1888
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvFH6DNRCY
1889

1896
Bad to the Bone, of course.
1897
Sia - Breathe Me
1898
WALKING ON FUCKING SUNSHINE.WHOOOOOA.

Maybe not in the actual movies themselves, but every time I hear "Everybody Dance Now" in the trailer of an upcoming comedy, I just know that it will be shit.
1900
Let My Love Open the Door.
1901
The answer might be George Thorogood's "Bad To The Bone".
1902
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadtotheBone
1903
If it's a medieval movie, they'll be playing the theme from Dragonheart.
1904
I bought that soundtrack after the movie came out, and was completely shocked how often I heard it playing on movie trailers after that.
1905
My first experience with the effect.
1906
Piggybacking off the OP, I'll add Highway to Hell, Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill (irked me a bit in Avengers, it's Tony's intro in IM2 then he makes no reference to them but does for Black Sabbath.)
1907
Anyway there's probably more I just can't think of them.
1908
Songs by Explosions in the Sky, I love them though.
1909
I'm sick and tired of all the Led Zeppelin that's in movies today.
1910
Gosh if they could be a little more lax on their licensing of their material.
1911
/sarcasm LZ rarely lets their music go into movies, the only instances i can think of was School of Rock, they used Immigrant Song in the van ride to Battle of the Bands and the cover of Immigrant song from Girl With The Dragon Tattoo
1912
Another one that's in trailers rather than movies is Mr. Blue Sky by ELO.

Tubthumping by Chumbawumba is the correct answer.
1920
Closing Time-Semisonic.

1946
Fix You by Coldplay.
1947
Used most recently (and obnoxiously) in an episode of The Newsroom when Gabrielle Giffords (the congresswoman) got shot.

1949
Lust for life by Iggy Pop.

Heroes - David Bowie
1951
Every time the city of Boston is mentioned in tv or film, you can be sure to hear Dropkick Murphys' "I'm Shipping off to Boston" in the background.

RT is horrible.
2019
The Tomato meter is a horrible way to judge things.
2020
For those of you unaware, the tomato meter is just a percentage of critics who thought the movie was a 7/10 or better.
2021
So mediocre, rubber stamp movies get insanely high ratings because so many critics give them 7/10s.
2022
I honestly think that if The Dark Knight had finished when Harvey Dent was in hospital it would have been a better film.
2023
wilhelm scream, rather the out right use of the wilhelm scream
2024
"Window Water Baby Moving" among other experimental films.
2025
It's just a bunch of really short shots (like a second or two) put together in an "artistic" movie.
2026
It just seems really forced and pretentious.
2027
There's another terrible one that is just one really long shot of a guy sitting in a chair, the camera pulls away, he yells and the camera zooms in really fast; it just happens over and over again for like 10 minutes.
2028
There was a period in the performance art community when cheap video recording was first invented that people would make these really long, really pointless videos.
2029
I've seen a few in various classes.
2030
All of the bad movies I've seen I'm glad I've seen them so I know how not to make a good movie.
2031
It's the "artsy" ones that really annoy me.
2032
Raising Arizona the fight scene in the trailer between John Goodman, his brother vs Nicholas Cage probably pretty realistic as to how it would go down in a trailer.
2033
There's been a lot of "Spielberg may do a movie bout" lately.
2034
Hero, Crouching Tiger, The Matrix, Equilibrium, Scott Pilgrim to name but a few.
2035
Kidding, but I do wish people would just read the fucking question sometimes.
2036
In all seriousness, though, Torn Curtain's killing of Gromek was insanely brutal for its time, and is still pretty nasty - though the woman dashing about for blunt objects is a little bit Looney Toons
2037
Let the Right One In, and its mystifying CGI cat-attack scene
2038
definitely not the best trailer, but I was so freaking excited when I saw the Last Airbender's first trailer.
2039
my mind was blown.but it turned out to be the worst movie ever.
2040
They Live.
2041
Nothing else ever.
2042
Phil Collins is also in Hook.
2043
Fear and Loathing or Pulp Fiction(or Reservoir Dogs if they've seen pulp).
2044
Nothing too dramatic.
2045
I tried showing my friend Apocalypse now once, that didn't go too well, nor did the time I tried to show my girlfriend Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
2046
Not to offend any Robocop fans, but no, just no.
2047
This movie should not be rebooted/remade.
2048
It will never achieve a quarter of the popularity that it received upon it's original release and will probably just be a handful of cliches mashed together.
2049
Triumph of the Will.
2050
I'm serious.
2051
I haven't seen the movie in a long time but from my understanding, Vesper killed herself because she had fallen in love with Bond, but was still loyal to her "boyfriend", the Quantum agent at the end of Quantum of Solace.
2052
She kills herself because she thinks if she remains alive, then Quantum will know she betrayed them, and will kill her boyfriend as punishment.
2053
So she kills herself to spare the boyfriend, but is simultaneously sad because she knows how Bond will feel.
2054
This is why Bond rages in the second movie, because he discovers she didn't have to kill herself at all, as her boyfriend was a fake.
2055
I haven't seen the film in years, but my guess is that Vesper had to keep up the act of being loyal to MI6.
2056
If she just gave away millions?* of pounds of government money with the high risk of losing it, alarm bells may have started ringing.
2057
*Unsure of specific amount of money
2058
Just because Le Chiffre says she's being tortured doesn't mean she actually is.
2059
People in movies tell lies too.
2060
The reason she didn't buy him out while getting pissed was probably to maintain her cover.
2061
If she had just bought him out it would look bad in her report, and Bond might've gotten suspicious.
2062
Also note that Le Chiffre was really going rogue against Quantum at this point, which is why he's executed by Mister White.
2063
If you look at the movie again, it's clear that Vesper doesn't become involved in the story until after Chiffre's first plot fails, with the airline bombing.
2064
Chiffre then proceeds to run his mad plan with the poker game in Monte Negro, which is to re-acquire the funds he lost.
2065
Quantum doesn't care about this though, and really just wants him dead.
2066
The reason she kills herself is pretty obvious, I think M puts it best, saying that she knew they'd come for her after she took the money.
2067
Basically she didn't think that she could ever live in peace.
2068
If I remember correctly, her boyfriend is Mister Green from Quantum of Solace, but that movie doesn't really explain much.
2069
although you should probably still watch it.
2070
It's never said if she was coerced before she met Bond or during their trip.
2071
All you really need to know is that she believed her 'boyfriend' was kidnapped and would be killed unless she helped Quantum succeed.
2072
She wasn't really tortured like you were led to believe.
2073
Le Chiffre most likely was going to torture her for the account information and the threat of him torturing her would essentially torture Bond.
2074
Bond could put up with the physical pain but emotionally he might crack if Le Chiffre tortured her.
2075
I believe that Le Chiffre might not have known that vesper was helping Quantum because Mr. White was the one in contact with her trying to clean up Le Chiffre's mess behind his back.
2076
Mr White showed up and killed Le Chiffre before they could torture Vesper/ kill Bond because he needed the account info and password to get the money back.
2077
2.Bond is pissed at her because he believed she really loved him only to find out she had been using him to get all the money for Quantum. he discovers she had secretly sent the hundreds of millions to a different account and was effectively funding the terrorist group Bond was tasked to stop.
2078
Vesper killed herself because she knew she was wrong.
2079
She had betrayed her country and Bond by channeling the terrorist's money for them and by killing herself she ended that investigation into her crimes there.
2080
She effectively kept Bond clean of the mess by not allowing him to try and defend her or deal with her when she would have been brought in and arrested.
2081
If she was captured by MI6 his life most likely would have also been ruined or he would have tried to help her in some way which could have implicated him as being complicit.
2082
WTF's up with the numbering system?
2083
From what I remember Vesper was a double agent the entire time and (I think) Mathers was as well.
2084
It was sort of skipped over whether he was actually innocent in the film although once Vesper has been shown to be guilty when Bond was asked whether Mathers should be released he says 'no'.
2085
So the way I see it, no one else in the Casino knew that Vesper was a double agent, she was told not to give Bond the money to buy pack in and if he won to take the money.
2086
Mathers is the one that did all the double agenty stuff in te casino.
2087
Just my view of it.

I'm no expert but it appears to be a mutant gorilla

Citizen Kane

If it wasn't for stranger than fiction i'd agree.
2129
One word for you.
2130
Mugatu.
2131
Don't be dissin' my boy Will.
2132
Stranger Than Fiction Everything Must Go Melinda and Melinda Land of the Lost All very different roles for him
2133
I submit: Megamind.
2134
Totally different to the buffoons he normally plays.
2135
I agree, although he does still manage to make me laugh sometimes.
2136
Adam Sandler, who does the same thing, never manages that.
2137
Its pretty true, then again I've never been let down by a Will Ferrell role.
2138
If its not broke don't fix it.
2139
that why i dont watch Ferrell or Sandler's comic roles anymore.
2140
but i did love stranger than fiction, everything must go and reign over me.
2141
Tell this to Jack Black, I hate him in a movie because he only plays Jack Black and completely takes me out of any movie I see him in.
2142
I think that Will is just in his twilight years in acting.
2143
Every comedian goes through this when they hit fame.
2144
They make a couple SNL flicks, then a few huge blockbusters, then a few indie flicks to try to prove that they can act, then they give up and just take massive paychecks for formulaic and tired comedy roles that leave their core fans walking out thinking "meh, what happened to him?".
2145
Then when all is exhausted, they turn to children's/family films until they get tired of being called tired and try to release new movies using their old formula which typically is severely played out and fail miserably but make a tonne of money.
2146
Then they disappear and have cameos in relevant things, usually noticed by adding the word "and" before their name in the opening credits and showing their name last.
2147
I was about to agree with the title of the post, but then I though about it a bit, and I still agree with the title.
2148
He seems to play the same happy-go-lucky, almost dumb, but rather simple minded guy in every movie.
2149
Granted I thought that about Owen Wilson but then I saw Midnight in Paris.
2150
Why do you disagree?
2151
Can you point to two titles where his acting is extremely contrasted?
2152
I would argue that his character in 'Anchorman' is completely different to say his character in 'The Other Guys' but the way he plays for laughs is very similar.
2153
The thing is though, I like WF's comic delivery.
2154
I could quite happily see him do the same thing over and over again just with different characters
2155
I don't he is attempting to make us happy, since we're the smaller portion of the audience that would take the time to analyze his character (or lack there of) roles.
2156
He is attempting to make the larger portion laugh with a similar performance in each film because that's what he's paid to do.
2157
He produces, yes, but he's only written a few of his bigger roles.
2158
anchorman, night at the roxberry, step brothers.
2159
All the rest are copied roles from his older films because they sell well, so that's why you see the same character over and over again.
2160
It's called type casting- jim carrey went through it, and perhaps ferrel isn't the same caliber of an actor, but he's not entirely to blame.
2161
Besides, his ashley shaffer character on eastbound and down is still pretty funny.
2162
Stranger Than Fiction and Everything Must Go are the exceptions.
2163
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
2164
Also, Nick Halsey in Everything Must Go.
2165
Very few actors play anyone but a version of themselves with minor variations.
2166
That's when someone comes around who can do it it's such a big deal.
2167
His comedic acting has become so unoriginal, it has pulled John C. Reilly in to its orbit.
2168
Kind of true, but that role's usually funny so its fine.
2169
Will Farrell movies are like pornos- Take a loose, basic plot and spread Will Farrell jokes throughout.
2170
The formula is brilliant.
2171
This is the kind of thing somebody says when they don't watch Will Ferrell movies.
2172
Acting "range" isn't always about doing a bunch of different things, it's also about doing similar things in a bunch of different ways.
2173
When you start naming Will Ferrell's characters, the differences between them are pretty obvious -- not just in terms of how they're written, but in terms of their emotional lives and how they feel.
2174
Ron Burgundy Ricky Bobby Chazz Michael Michaels Jackie Moon Brennan Huff Megamind Mugatu Buddy the Elf Frank Ricard If you've actually seen these movies, I don't know how you see these characters as indistinct.
2175
They each have very specific feels to them that are different from all the others.
2176
Will Ferrell's versatility problem is more a problem with his marketing than his performances.
2177
His performances have a lot of variety and subtlety.
2178
It's just that his movie posters and commercials make it look like all his movies are the same when they're not.
2179
And if it sells his movies, it's debatable that this is an actual problem.
2180
I think he's versatile, but it also seems like that in MOST of his popular movies, it's the same type of character.
2181
Loud, obnoxious, somewhat dim-witted, and occasionally awkward.
2182
But like someone else said, it works, so why change?
2183
Not so sure about Will Ferrell.
2184
I think Ben Stiller more than anyone else.
2185
Will ferrell is about nuance.
2186
You think he's playing dimwitted characters in all of his movies (anchorman, old school, kicking and screaming) but those movies are big budget and designed to appeal to a wide audience.
2187
Also for the most part, if you're going to cast WF, you're going to be appealing to a wide audience.
2188
However, not all of his movies do, Melinda and Melinda, Stranger than Fiction, Everything Must Go, Casa de Mi Padre; in these movies he plays what may seem like the same character, but with nuances in each performance that make each of them shine in their own way.
2189
will ferrell = unfunny
2190
That one movie where will ferrel has to sleep on the lawn was pretty different.
2191
Everything must go.
2192
Also he made a Mexican soap opera movie in gringo Spanish.
2193
Casa de mi padre.
2194
Megamind was a voice acting role, I don't know if I count it as different but he was awesome in it.
2195
So basically fuck you.
2196
Edit: forgot to add in "Stranger than Fiction" that was very different than his normal shtick.
2197
You shut your fucking mouth is the only explanation neccessary!
2198
In most movies they'll bash each other's faces in without really doing damage to their hands, or so it seems.
2199
Though probably not a popular movie around here, I felt like in Batman Forever when The Riddler punches a tied up guard was pretty accurate haha.
2200
I like switching it up often.
2201
For some reason I like reorganizing them while one of my favorites is playing in the background.
2202
KingofKL explained it spot on.Armageddon and Deep Impact are two more examples of that happening.
2203
There are many more.
2204
Added to watch later, thanks.
2205
Netflix pulled this from streaming but The Horseman is a pretty cool, violent, Ausie revenge flick.
2206
IMHO, worth watching also if you get DVD's.
2207
added to the que.
2208
Thanks for the suggestion
2209
Hollywood is not a big place.
2210
Producers will talk.
2211
Ideas that float around will float around.
2212
So it could be: By chance - several studio execs hear the same general idea floating around.
2213
By timing - e.g.
2214
Not really any Vietnam War movies prior to '78, but when they came, you had a lot.
2215
This is related to when it's OK to deal with the issues, as well as anniversaries etc.
2216
Defense - they hear a competing studio is making a movie, and decide to make a similar movie to compete
2217
The director reclines in his chair, moaning in ecstasy from the blowjob he's being given by a hot young thing.
2218
Suddenly she stops.
2219
The director grunts his disapproval.
2220
"You know," she says with a flick of her golden locks, "This other director I used to blow is making a film about dinosaurs.
2221
I like dinosaurs."
2222
She resumes giving the blowjob, but the director's mind is racing.
2223
His penis soon grows flaccid.
2224
With a shout of rage, he pushes her away.
2225
He knows that until he beats the other director and releases a better dinosaur movie first, he will never be able to enjoy his blowjob sessions with whats-her-name ever again.
2226
"Fuck!" he yells, bound up in thoughts about being able to achieve such a feat.
2227
He'd need to pull all his strings to get together a budget and a team capable of smashing out a feature film in record time.
2228
And of course he'd need a script.
2229
He's zipped up his pants now, pacing back and forth muttering about financials and deadlines.
2230
He grabs the phone and makes a few calls.
2231
The wheels are in motion.
2232
Three months later, on a shoestring budget and with many shortcuts taken, our director is once more able to lounge and enjoy the silky lips of, well, a completely different Hollywood slut.
2233
Critics be damned.
2234
They don't suck his nuts.
2235
It's actually pretty well written and directed.
2236
The funeral scene where they pan over to Kutcher wearing his bright yellow Michigan sweatshirt was hilarious.
2237
I like it, but I'm a sucker for Portman.
2238
I think the fight scene in Red's apartment in Pineapple Express most accurately portrays how I would perform in a fight.
2239
I like the sauna scene in Eastern Promises.
2240
Extremely violent and it feels very realistic.
2241
In the same vein as Eastern Promises, the diner scene in A History of Violence is very efficient, gritty, and realistic.
2242
Once the first man is hit by a pot of coffee, he never gets back up to fight, but can only stab Viggo's foot after laboriously crawling to him.
2243
Beside's Viggo's nerves of steel, I imagine that's as realistic as a fight scene can get, quick and brutal.
2244
The knife fight in Saving Private Ryan
2245
What this thread is: "I've never been in a real fight, but I have a feeling that if I did, it would be like this."
2246
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iz7ktIdEYthe store fight in the departed i think, especially the fact that his hand is fucked after a few hits.
2247
I'm not sure if gunfights count, but this shootout from No Country for Old Men felt extremely realistic.
2248
Not really a fight scene as in hand to hand combat, but the beginning of Saving Private Ryan with people begging for their mothers as they lay dying is brutal, realistic, and horrific.
2249
The fight scene in They Live is the most realistic, as well as being one of the best fight scenes of any movie.
2250
Everything from "Kung Fu Hustle"
2251
Does a sword fight scene count.
2252
In Rob Roy, Liam Neeson and Tim Roth have the best sword fight duel.
2253
Very realistic, in how the fight progresses.
2254
and a great ending to it.
2255
I can't link cause I'm at work, but it should be on you tube.
2256
The fight scene in the first bridget jones diaries was pretty realistic.
2257
Most realistic fight scene ive seen!
2258
The end of 28 Days Later.
2259
Short and brutal.
2260
I'd would have to vote for the movie 'Haywire'.
2261
I didn't care for the movie, but it had the most realistic and brutal fight scenes I have seen in a movie.
2262
Step Brothers, Will Ferrel vs. John C. Rielly.
2263
Most realistic fight scene ever.
2264
One of the most realistic fight scenes was actually from the Jet Li movie Unleashed.
2265
He punches a huge guy in the throat three times and kills him in five seconds.
2266
The violence in Drive was brilliant
2267
This http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SK0cUNMnMM
2268
In Safehouse, the fight scenes are pretty brutal and realistic.
2269
The characters involved in each fight are usually battered and broken afterwards, they don't just get up and continue on like nothing happened.

The thumbnail seems right.I only hope the clip includes the bit before the fight when Mike plans out how he expects it to go): http://www.anyclip.com/movies/dazed-and-confused/fight/
2284
No one has mentioned the fight scenes from the two Bridget Jones movies?
2285
It seems that's how most men with no training would most likely go about it, arms flailing, lame kicks, chasing , those scenes are hilarious.
2286
Every fucking scene in The Raid, I mean you're really get the feeling that they're actually hitting someone.
2287
Edit: sorry, it is indeed not realistic :/
2288
I know 'scream' is a horror movie, but it is the only movie I have seen where the victim is actually smart enough to close a door, or hit the bastard in the face with a bottle or something.
2289
Rather than just screaming and standing there wide eyed at your guys get ripped out.
2290
Use logic movie people!
2291
I thought the fight scenes in RocknRolla were incredibly realistic.
2292
this is the most realistic I've seen
2293
Near the beginning of Treasure of the Sierra Madre, there's a fight scene where both guys get exhausted until they're staggering around and barely able to keep fighting.
2294
Duel from Rob Roy.
2295
Granted, most duels ended within the first 10 seconds, but this is incredibly solid stuff.
2296
Drexl Spivey and Clarence Worley (True Romance).
2297
The bathroom fight from Casino Royale is one of my favorites.
2298
If we're talking about sheer realism, most fights I've ever seen are between two guys that are furious with each other, yet don't know how to fight.
2299
They also really don't want to get hurt.
2300
For that, I have to give the fight scene in Bridget Jones' Diary the title of one of the most realistic fight scenes ever.
2301
Yes.
2302
I am serious.
2303
The bourne fights have realistic and effective moves, but they still manage to take superhuman beatings.
2304
The most realistic fight scene of a guy being outmatched is for me at the end of Eastern Promises, when Viggo Mortensen kills two burly guys naked with carpet cutters.
2305
It's not pretty, and neither is real violence.
2306
Also, like only one other guy said, Drive was pretty believable as well by showcasing the effort and violence it takes to save your life.
2307
Oldboy.
2308
The hallway seen is both badass and realistic, the dude get's fucked up!
2309
Colin Farrell and Edward Norton in Pride and Glory
2310
As far as tactics and techniques go, Taken has some of the most realistic fighting in it.
2311
EDIT: And yeah, the Bourne films are good.
2312
The fight between Cataleya and Marco(?) in the bathroom in Colombiana
2313
Never back down, some of the worst acting, scripting, photography, and direction, but my god, those fight scenes are amazing.
2314
The hallway fight scene from Oldboy was incredible and all shot in one take.
2315
Here it is
2316
Haywire.
2317
But I feel like I'm cheating.
2318
Old Boy in the corridor.
2319
I'll look for a vid.
2320
The Hallway scene in "Oldboy".
2321
I remember very few fight scenes where the guy throwing the one single connecting punch breaks his hand while the guy being punched blacks out.
2322
This after a few short minutes of uncoordinated flailing and chaotic wrestling, of course.
2323
Which is how most fights in real life play out.
2324
The fight with the guy who wields the giant sword in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
2325
While not as epic as some here, certainly the most realistic I can think of.
2326
Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in From Russia With Love
2327
Honestly pineapple express.anyone
2328
else? Bunch of idiots fighting it out
2329
In Rob Roy, there is a sword duel between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth that is very realistic, in that it emphasizes the physical strain of fighting with heavy broad swords.
2330
Goldeneye: 007 vs. 006This one has the feeling of two pros who are VERY well-trained in fighting techniques, but it's also intensely personal and fought in very close-quarters.
2331
Terrific photography and editing help.
2332
Hammerfight.
2333
Anything done by Jackie Chan.
2334
The scrap between Elias and Barnes in Platoon is about as realistic a fight scene as you're going to get.
2335
The Hunted: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269347/
2336
Michael York and Christopher Lee's final fight in The Four Musketeers.
2337
Both have been fighting others when they finally encounter each other.
2338
D'artagnon (York) is in shock, having found his love Constance dead.
2339
Rochefort (Lee) is feeling arogant "Run, Boy!" he shouts.
2340
But d'Artagnon looks at him with rage and shouts "Murderer" and goes berserk.
2341
The look of surprise and even sudden fear on Rochefort's face is satisfying.
2342
It is a fight to the death; but they are both already tired and hurting.
2343
They stagger and pant, lunge and struggle to stay afoot.
2344
Compare their fight scene to Jedi leaping and bounding with never a pant of weariness?
2345
- and you are comparing real acting and with plastic game animation.
2346
American History X
2347
Raid Redemption.
2348
Period.
2349
This movie kicks ass and is amazing with their "one take" shots.
2350
I think that the movie: The Black Death had really realistic fight scenes.
2351
Although the movie only had 10 minutes of fighting, it was extremely violent.
2352
The movie overall is very depressing though.
2353
Bathroom scene in Bourne Ultimatum
2354
The single greatest fight scene Harrison Ford has ever done, also the most realistic.
2355
Personally I like the final fight scene in Flashpoint with Donnie Yen Vs Collin Chou http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoYfzvAYJY
2356
The Raid: Redemption.
2357
Long shots (for kung-fu scenes) and you can almost feel every punch.
2358
Fight Club also has some realistic fight scenes
2359
Casino Royale
2360
The Hunted with Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones.
2361
Very realistic and well choreographed Kali style fight scenes.
2362
The fights are short and brutal.
2363
It has a wide range of scenes, including knife-knife, hand-knife, and hand-hand.
2364
Scene Starts at 2:40 Training scene The Departed scene in the grocery is pretty realistic.
2365
It's fast, brutal, and Leo breaks his hand on the guy's face when he punches with his off hand.
2366
Plus, the dialogue leading up to it is pretty epic.
2367
"You keep on calling me Babu, it's Singh motherfucker."
2368
I was impressed with the fighting in Pineapple Express because they're not great at fighting.
2369
This one from Raiders of the Lost Ark
2370
This is late to the party and will probably be buried but The sex/fight scene from Shoot em Up. "talk about blowing your load"
2371
The Matrix was realistic.
2372
guys.?
2373
Step brothers
2374
Suprised no one has said Marathon Man.
2375
Brutal and realistic.
2376
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asGnaw3vSCU
2377
The Raid: Redemption has great fight scenes!
2378
The fight scenes from the movie Barfly.
2379
Totally brutal and inelegant.
2380
Indiana Jones in Raiders, the scene where he fights the guy with swords.
2381
The first fight scene from the orinal Walking Tall was pretty good.
2382
An ex wrestler fighting a bunch of thugs in an illegal gambling joint.
2383
Some of the fights in Ip Man
2384
I really like this one from Quantum of Solace.
2385
It's a little more awkward and a lot less smooth than most Bond scenes.
2386
I know I am late to the party, but the sword fight in Rashomon is probably one of the more realistic scenes I have seen.
2387
It's messy, somewhat uncoordinated, and changed my thoughts on what sword fights would actually be like.
2388
I don't know if it classes as a fight scene, but for me, this is the best depiction of the sheer aggression of a violent assault.
2389
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHJ5pzTGtag&t=0m28s
2390
The film is lock stock and the actor is Vinnie Jones an ex football player noted for his violent and dickish tendencies on and off the pitch.
2391
How swollen that guys face gets in fight club, and most of the film due to the residual injuries
2392
Tommy Lee Jones vs. Benicio Del Toro knife fight in the Hunted so sick!
2393
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izw6ZsPSp0
2394
Ong Bak.
2395
Realistic as in it looks as though they are really getting hurt.
2396
I don't know if anyone can actually fight like this unless they've had some ninja training.
2397
The entirety of The Raid: Redemption.
2398
The fight scene at the end of Unbreakable.
2399
Starts at about 35 seconds in, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-waJsBs0eBQ&playnext=1&list=PL5523F7B61187DE61&feature=resultsvideo
2400
Jet Li: Unleashed.
2401
Also called 'Danny The Dog'.
2402
Very gritty.
2403
The hits that landed you really felt, in the way that someone doesn't react instantly to a hit normally.
2404
Does this count as a fight scene?
2405
if so, it's probably the most realistic.
2406
Good Will Hunting fight scene.
2407
The Hunted had some great hand to hand combat as well as realistic knife fighting techniques IMO.
2408
Here's a link to the end knife fight scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izw6ZsPSp0 EDIT: That clip is dubbed and sounds real shitty, but the point is there haha
2409
Man From Nowhere - Knife Fight
2410
ip man
2411
The fistfight in tampopo.
2412
This is a very tiny scene, but I feel like it's about as realistic as you can get in this type of movie: The Departed - Leo hurts the two men from Providence.
2413
There's a scuffle, a couple punches, then Leo breaks/fractures something in his hand and can't keep punching.
2414
So he takes a foreign object and continually bludgeons a guy until he's asked to leave, which he does.
2415
Nothing fancy, but definitely seems like a realistic outcome for a fight.
2416
Kingdom of Heaven.
2417
For me it would have to be the swordfight at the end of the Roman Polanski version of MacBeth-in this scene, people are swinging swords seemingly almost at random, launching attacks that don't actually go all that near to their target, and Macbeth and Macduff look like they are having trouble lifting their heavy swords at times.
2418
It basically looks like two guys with some training in swordfighting are trying to kill each other, not like a perfectly choreographed scene with perfectly trained godly fighters.
2419
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6VrmOQY1M
2420
Daesu's fight scene If someone were to fight 20 guys in a crowded hallway, this is how you would do it.
2421
The most realistic and gritty fight has been in A Short Film About Killing by Kristof Kieslowski - a tussle between a taxi driver and a murderer in a taxi while he tries to strangle him that lasts for about 4 minutes.
2422
I can't find the specific scene, but here's the whole movie, be warned, it's hard going because of its content.
2423
Rod vs Frank from "Hot Rod"
2424
Bourne movies, Eastern Promises bathhouse knife fight, Sinners and Saints and Taken all were good, but I think Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace have two of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.
2425
Casino Royale: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvr6uRvESvM
2426
Quantum of Solace: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvYB5Z7PWTk
2427
Oldboy, the hammer in the hallway scene.
2428
Most Jackie Chan movies had real fight scenes in them.
2429
The best fight scene I've ever seen was The Princess Bride sword fight between the Masked Man (Westley) and Inigo Montoya.
2430
The pool hall brawl from Mean Streets.
2431
http://youtu.be/Tx6fbGBYi84
2432
Irreversible.
2433
No mention of the fights from Valhalla Rising?
2434
Jeeze.
2435
Most realistic I've seen.
2436
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ozdCJJ6osg
2437
John Cusack vs Benny Urquidez in Grosse Pointe Blank.
2438
Starts off quite technical, then quickly descends into a ground scrap.
2439
Not a movie, but the fight between Tony and Ralph on The Sopranos.
2440
Taking this and running with it a bit - The Inbetweeners Movie has a fight scene which is most like the real ones I've ever seen.
2441
The final duel in Roman Polanski's Macbeth.A really good depiction of how these guys would have fought when in full armour.
2442
No frills, they're lucky if they get a good hit at each other every ten seconds.
2443
Jackie Chan's "Who Am I?" The last fight scene, of course a bit exaggerated, was pure fighting.no
2444
CGI, no special effects.
2445
Just high quality action
2446
The first time Ed Nortan punches Brad Pitt in fight club, because he actually did punch him.
2447
I've heard on many occasions that Daniel Day-Lewis in "the Boxer" has some of the most realistic boxing scenes ever.
2448
13 Assassins seemed to have it right for realistic sword play, parry and kill, parry and kill, dodge dodge parry, kill kill kill.
2449
Although, for straight up brawling I'd have to say this scene from HBO's Deadwood pretty much nailed it.
2450
Tough for me to judge realism, but the fights in Safe House seemed more real than most in a really brutal, satisfying way.
2451
Bathhouse fight scene from eastern promises.
2452
Fucking beautifully choreographed
2453
The very first fight scene in Fight Club when Tyler Durden told him to hit him.
2454
He punched him in the ear which is what an inexperienced fighter would do.
2455
Also, probably the fight scene between Bane and Batman in the sewers.
2456
Definitely 2012.
2457
This is extreme, but I'd rather watch Twilight on loop in a theatre filled with 250 obnoxious middle school girls than that sad excuse for a movie.
2458
The good guy winning.
2459
It's one of the reasons I love No Country for Old Men.
2460
French Bread in the grocery bag.
2461
Drives me fucking nuts.
2462
Although I completely agree with you, this is basically what almost every review has said.
2463
I wish Spielburg and Hanks would do a Korea or Vietnam series.
2464
The WW II stuff has been great.
2465
It'd be nice if they would keep on going.
2466
New York City MUST be attacked first.
2467
The chick side-kick faces off with the chick-badguy at the end of the film leaving the 'men' to their business.
2468
Amusing irony on the one hand as its yet another religious nut abusing kids in his care Tragic irony on the other hand as this does nothing to help the image of men in elementary/primary education.
2469
The Departed
2470
The last few seconds of Cabin in the Woods could have been happily cut, I think.
2471
Still loved the movie, though.
2472
The whole Dark Knight trilogy and Fight Club.
2473
Oh, and The Avengers.
2474
I saw it twice with friends and liked it even less the second time.
2475
It's a muddled mess of them fighting more with each other than with the (not explained well at all) bad guys.
2476
Sure, Loki had backstory, but they never bothered to explain to non-comic readers who the hooded guy was or where the aliens came from.
2477
The final battle was boring rinse-and-repeat.
2478
Thor was basically one long commercial.
2479
The new super-duper long Cloud Atlas trailer is pretty impeccable.
2480
The Bad Boys II Trailer screened in front of the Matrix Reloaded and had me tingling in excitement from beginning to end.
2481
I hadn't even seen the first one when I saw this trailer the first time, but I saw Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and knew of Bad Boys 1 since I had The Rock on VHS and knew of Michael Bay.
2482
Despite the movie not living up to this trailer, I can rewatch this trailer again and again and still feel the ride that Bad Boys I eventually brought me on.
2483
Great music, great visuals, great fun mood; Great trailer for a fun movie.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AURhd5TCG6U
2484
Sin City gets my vote
2485
I watched the "The Hobbit" trailer 100 times, and I'm gonna watch it 100 more times until it comes out.
2486
I get chills every damn time.
2487
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (David Fincher's version).
2488
This thing had me going for months.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVLvMg62RPA
2489
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3orQKBxiEg, great trailer for a great movie.
2490
This may be technically a promo, as opposed to a "trailer", but this advert won awards.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWrbGEFgI8
2491
We've been over this before.
2492
the only answer is Pootie Tang
2493
Reservoir Dogs Before Sunset Amelie Lost in Translation If I'm flipping through channels and one of those happens to be on, I'll put the remote down and watch it completely.
2494
I already own those movies on DVD by the way.
2495
So Elizabeth Taylor looks amazing no matter what and Paul Newman looks like he could be Neal McDonough's dad.
2496
I like James Berardinelli a lot, sometimes.
2497
other times I find him off his rocker, but either way I do usually like his commentary and how he presents it.
2498
Website: www.reelviews.net
2499
So here's the thing.
2500
I highly recommend you don't limit yourself to only watching "modern" comedies (some of my favorite movies are pre-1990's).
2501
I don't know what your type of humor is, but if you like awkward movies I recommend Submarine.
2502
It has a very similar sort of feel to The Graduate (which you should definitely definitely see if you haven't yet) from a younger, more innocent perspective.
2503
A great watch.
2504
If you like mockumentaries (e.g.
2505
The Office, Parks and Rec., Modern Family) I think you'd like This is Spinal Tap.
2506
I guess Spinal Tap isn't as underrated as some, but it definitely flies under the radar.
2507
If you haven't seen it, it's about a once-popular rock band that is trying to find its way back to relevancy.
2508
but they're really bad.
2509
Really good.
2510
Really funny.
2511
And finally, one of my favorites that's pretty popular on Reddit is Punch-Drunk Love by PT Anderson.
2512
This one also slipped by me for the longest time.
2513
It actually stars Adam Sandler, who I normally despise, but he does an incredible job in this movie.
2514
It's kind of dark but it's also really heart-warming.
2515
This movie, though popular, is too underrated for my liking.
2516
Watch it if you haven't.
2517
I think the movie Hot Rod is severely underrated.
2518
It's fun for the whole family!
2519
:D.if you're family likes dick jokes and grilled cheese sandwiches fighting tacos.just
2520
trust me on this one.
2521
I liked it too (haven't seen the original) but making everyone, especially Colin Farrell and Bill Nighy use American accents was incredibly poor decision making.
2522
I'll do my best to piece together what was wrong with it.
2523
It's a bad Indiana Jones film, but would have done pretty well had it not been associated with the series.
2524
The previous films have a lot to do with religious and spiritual artifacts, and while the Crystal Skulls are definitely religious to the Mayan people, the extraterrestrial theme is overplayed.
2525
Back to the Crystal Skulls.
2526
This could have been done very well, but they mixed in everything that had anything to do with South American and Central American mythology.
2527
El Dorado, Crystal Skulls, Aztec Calendar, just a mish mash of contradicting and irrelevant bits of history.
2528
Russian villains.
2529
They should have kept the Nazis as the villains, because even though the film takes place in 1957, many Nazis fled to South America and took refuge.
2530
This would have been a nice homage to the trilogy, and they wouldn't have had to deal with introducing too many new ideas into one film.
2531
Family.
2532
The Last Crusade has a lot to do with the reconciliation between Dr. Jones and Indy, and it felt like this film was trying to replicate that same theme.
2533
Problem is, they threw both a mother and son into the mix.
2534
They should have left Marion out of it and focused on Indy and The kid (anyone but Shia Labeouf), or chucked the kid and focused on Marion and Indy.
2535
And that's all I have to say about that.
2536
Tropic Thunder.
2537
"You done gone full retard."
2538
I loved how it tackled heavy subjects like the use of blackface and retardation but still kept it funny.
2539
Ya know what strikes me as odd?
2540
Why, as nation, do we choose to act as if the past didn't happen?
2541
I do realize that the Confederate flag holds a negative connotation for some, but it is a part of American history, and should be accepted as thus.
2542
If we are to start censoring minuscule details, such as this, where does it end?
2543
Where will it lead America as a nation?
2544
In today's society, books have taken the back seat when it comes to educational material.
2545
Today's generation tends to "watch" more than "read".
2546
Therefore, if we censor details, minuscule as this specific one may be, we could potentially be eradicating an important piece of history from the minds of generations to come.
2547
Now, I don't want this to sound as if I am condoning what this flag stands for, but regardless of the ideas behind it, it still serves as a reminder of America's past.
2548
If this flag is politically incorrect in today's society, then we should do away with race specific colleges, scholarships, government (state or federal) programs, etc. Today's America is one of ignorance.
2549
What do I mean by this?
2550
We are ignorant of the society we are preparing for the future.
2551
Pulling the Confederate flag from the General Lee would essentially be the same as pulling Huck Finn from the shelves or censor any movie that makes any racial statement, for example: American History X, Forrest Gump, The Color Purple, Glory, Crash, The Green Mile, Ali, Malcolm X, etc.
2552
I know some of this is a bit of a stretch, but you see my point.
2553
Censorship equals ignorance.
2554
And yet people think these so-called intellectual "property" laws actually perform some useful service for our society, when the reality is that copyrights and patents stifle innovation and keep the public from enjoying the culture that we all have already paid for.
2555
The General Lee on the Universal Lot also has its flag covered by orange plastic.
2556
uggh.can we all just get over the dukes of hazard already!
2557
studies also show that energy drinks may shut down your kidneys.
2558
Keanu gets too much shit about how "he didn't act at all in the Matrix lol".
2559
If you watch him in smaller roles he really shines as a semi-character actor, and he was fucking badass in some other action movies like Speed.
2560
He seems like a cool guy, and I hope this movie does well.
2561
I will probably be shunned for this opinion but i don't consider Lucas a great.
2562
I think he's a one trick pony who got lucky that SW took off.
2563
If it wasn't for GREAT minds like Irvin, Speilberg, Leigh, Gloria, Willard and Lawerence being involved with movies such as the Indiana Jones trilogy and Empire they would of ended up more of the same filth.
2564
And yes i will agree that THX/American Graffiti were good movies, THX over Graffiti but Star Wars?
2565
Great movie and imagination but how much of it was really even that original?
2566
How many scenes were shot for shot stolen from other films later to be explained as "homages" or "inspirations".
2567
He was like the Tarantino of the 70s/80s only Tarantino can actually WRITE.
2568
/rant Downvote away, what he did to the prequel trilogy has nothing to do with my hatred towards lucas.
2569
I am not even that big of a Star Wars fan.
2570
lol, lena dunham is included in this?
2571
The only things that sadden me about this whole debate is that viewer experience isn't at the heart of their thought process but the directors act like it is.
2572
Directors don't want digital above film because it's a better format.
2573
In terms of picture quality, it's clearly worse.
2574
They want digital because it's cheaper.
2575
3D isn't the future.
2576
I hate it how people who don't like 3D are often compared to those who didn't like the introduction of sound, or the introduction of colour.
2577
It's not remotely the same.
2578
3D is about 30% less bright than 2D, it gives everyone a headache, and it completely alters the way we focus our eyes on different shots.
2579
Have you noticed how, no matter how many times you see a 3D movie, you only remember it in 2D?
2580
The 3D effect isn't even impressive.
2581
The only reason studios prefer it iiiiiiiissss.
2582
Piracy.
2583
It'll stop you from bringing in your shitty camera into the cinema and filming the whole thing.
2584
I'm not against 3D in principle.
2585
That being said, the technology isn't remotely there right now.
2586
As things stand, great films should be (and almost always are) shot in 2D and on film.
2587
It's just heartbreaking to hear David Lynch saying he's done with movies.
2588
He definitely has his place in cinema history.
2589
Come on, this title is so misleading.
2590
I don't like Romney but give the guy a break, he came across well in this instance and I think he said the right things.
2591
None of them contradict what he's been campaigning on.
2592
On Abortion: "There are two lives at stake: the unborn child and the mom - and I care for both of them" That doesn't sound like someone who supports abortion.
2593
With regards to contraception.
2594
All he said was that he believed people had the right to use it.
2595
That doesn't contradict any of his viewpoints.
2596
Just because he doesn't believe there should be a mandate to include birth-control in health insurance, doesn't mean he's against contraception altogether.
2597
I am a fan of Obama but I don't want him to win the election based on lies and misinformation.
2598
EDIT: Moreover, we should be supporting the fact that he completely and unequivocally rebuked the statements of Todd Akin.
2599
That's clearly the obvious thing to do but it's important that both candidates are offering maximum condemnation of what he said.
2600
I felt there was way too much time talking, if it was up to me I'd of made the whole film action packed.
2601
the only pieces of dialogue I would of kept in were the Terminator references made to Arnold, so cliche, but that's the point!
2602
It could of been longer.
2603
I don't think Van Dam had enough scenes to show off.
2604
well.
2605
himself.
2606
That knife to the heart kick was awesome though.
2607
It was perfect for what it was supposed to be, a super cheesy action flick.
2608
Like Tomb760 said, it could have used more action and more Van Dam, but it worked.
2609
personally the Chuck Norris scenes were my favorite, I would have loved to see more of him in the movie.
2610
There was some lame stuff just like the first.
2611
But seeing Arnold blow people away with that awesome gun after all these years was a great boost of nostalgia.
2612
Go Arnold.
2613
You know what I found really odd about The Expendables 2? They kept having Statham's character's girlfriend call him, like all the time.
2614
Stallone would give him shit for it, and he'd walk off and talk to his girl.
2615
The phone had this super annoying ring, and the movie kept drilling in this whole concept that Statham was pussy-whipped.
2616
I was certain, CERTAIN that The Expendables would be hiding somewhere or otherwise engaged in a stealth activity and that phone was going to go off.
2617
But it never happened.
2618
That whole plot thread, Statham answering his phone all the time, went absolutely nowhere.
2619
It was like they just cut the payoff for it or something.
2620
It really stood out to me for some reason.
2621
All I want is to make something one day that has these guys, in that lighting, in that color, and then a white title with some movement.
2622
Can never forget this.
2623
Scrolled through the bottom just to read that Fincher is working on The Girl who Played with Fire.
2624
Damn, have anyone else have problem with playing the video?
2625
I really wanna see this.
2626
If I didn't love him unconditionally, I would think he was a douchebag.
2627
But I do love him.
2628
I don't think I've ever seen a talk show guest (or host for that matter) drinking a hot beverage.
2629
When I first noticed the steam I was wondering if he had a cigarette in his hands.
2630
its crazy to think from Ford's perspective during this interview.
2631
He says he hopes blade runner is "engaging, stimulating, and full of wonderful ideas".
2632
He has no idea how well this movie is going to do or how people will like it.
2633
Fast forward 40 years and it is still considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, in almost every aspect.
2634
Funny, however, that it didn't do so well right away.
2635
It took people awhile to like it.
2636
"Blade Runner takes place 40 years in the future" There's only 10 to go.
2637
AI with the boy staring forever at the blue fairy.
2638
LOST after season 5.
2639
I think Jude Law and Ethan Hawk should have switched rolls in GATTACA
2640
The Road to Eldorado and Toy Story (the first one) I'm working on memorizing The Dark Knight and the Avenger when it comes out in America.
2641
Clerks 2
2642
But that porn star chick said she supported Romney
2643
Anything to sell some books.
2644
It was a good movie, saw it on Netflix.
2645
"I'm just going to do this bad thing / dangerous job ONE last time and then I'm getting out of the game / retiring" - dies.
2646
how after a sexual encounter people look fucking amazing and freshly made up
2647
Getting shot only requires pulling out the bullet (which is always just under the surface) and a bit of bandage and the character can go back to whatever they were doing
2648
Things blowing up so easily; cars in particular.
2649
Romantic sub-plots shoehorned into movies that in no way require a romantic sub-plot.
2650
Villains that hesitate.
2651
In way too many climatic endings the villain will dramatically hesitate just before administering the coup de grace on the staggered hero just to demonstrate how villainous the villain is.
2652
In that moment the hero will act fast and kill the overconfident exposed villain.
2653
It's a lazy stupid cheap trick.
2654
Good villains have conviction, good villains don't hesitate.
2655
Unlimited resources.
2656
Planning to rob a bank for 100K?
2657
Better go buy thousands of dollars worth of equipment, clothes, a couple of vehicles and a HELICOPTER just in case.
2658
Every grenade causing a big fiery explosion.
2659
Grenades don't do that.
2660
No teacher/professor has a sense of time.
2661
They are always in the middle of a lecture when the bell rings and everybody rushes out the door.
2662
The main guy, and the main girl, simply must fall in love.
2663
How the whole conflict in the plot can be explained by "wait just listen for a minute".
2664
Instead the character is getting in trouble for something and not able to explain himself because no one listens.
2665
That just makes me mad.
2666
ridiculously handsome guy meets ridiculously beautiful girl and yet the premise is "Will they or won't they" Single Token urban friend (Male or female whose only character arc is to say at some point "Gurrrllll!
2667
" or "Bust a cap in yo ass" Girl sleep over sing/dance montage The segue phone call "Hi, its me, I found the info you've been searching the last two hours, meet me at my office, goodbye" seriously?
2668
If I spent the last two hours looking for something, tell me on the phone right now, why do I have to drive 45 minutes to hear it from you The hang up without saying goodbye or this call is over.
2669
Both parties just seem to know the conversation is over.
2670
Main hero injured?
2671
better get him an arm sling Main hero knocked unconscious?
2672
no long term brain injury,ever.
2673
When a character stumbles across another character doing something really weird or shitty and he says ''Wait, it's not what it looks like!'' and the other character storms out of the room pissed or weirded out.
2674
Wait til he explains what's going on you retard!
2675
Average dudes paired with women 4 times out of their league.
2676
I get why it happens, I just wish we could accept normal looking people in relationships.
2677
Single parent, children hate parent.
2678
After going through the traumatic movie plot the children love parent, and they live happily ever after.
2679
1 bad guy = 10 minute fight when 20 bad guys = 1 punch is a killing blow.
2680
How bombs always get disarmed with 1 second left.
2681
Not a cliche per se but i hate it when the death of extras aren't held accountable for.
2682
ANYTHING involving computers, especially any sort of hacking or government/military use.
2683
The interfaces are always so unnecessarily graphical.
2684
They always tend to have some spinning diagrams hovering over their type interface, random numbers scrolling in the background, maps for some reason etc.
2685
"Zoom in and enhance."
2686
cars are magical tanks.
2687
cars will be able to weave through traffic because the drivers are just that awesome.
2688
red light?
2689
no problem.
2690
you won't get hit, and even if you do, your car will still run.
2691
engine bashed up? just push on the accelerator more.
2692
no tires?
2693
only a minor setback.
2694
People playing chess never realise they are about to be checkmated, chess doesn't work like that.
2695
The bad guy explaining the entire plan to the hero who is "tied up".
2696
Actually just bad guys that are generally weak/unwilling to commit/unprepared.
2697
I like a bad guy that doesn't fuck around.
2698
"Oh, I caught you.
2699
You're dead."
2700
BLAM!
2701
And Henchmen that aren't mentally retarded and can only grimace, heaven forbid they have a speaking role.
2702
Maybe that's why I'm enjoying Game of Thrones so much, because it's definitely NOT that.
2703
Ostracized and socially awkward nerdy girl removes glasses, shakes hair and bam! She's a hottie.
2704
The predictability and almost identical pacing of many suspense/horror films.
2705
The good guy talks to a bad guy on his death bed and the bad guy reveals everything he knows that may help the good guy.
2706
If Bruce Willis just shot me in the hip and spleen, I wouldn't tell him anything.
2707
When someone says something sort of meaningful and then at the end of the film at some perfect moment someone says that line again (usually back to the person who said it first) and then everything is ok
2708
I hate how no one says "goodbye" before hanging up the phone.
2709
Fight scenes that go on way longer than anyone's stamina could hold up.
2710
After a while of non-stop acrobatics and the 20th hit to the head, even I'm tired.
2711
When the good guy is in a fight with a whole group of bad guys, and they each wait their turn to have their ass kicked.
2712
Gang fights don't go down like that!
2713
Be for real fools!
2714
Might as well give them a number "Number 4 your ass kicking.Next!"
2715
"Head them off at the pass!"
2716
I hate that cliche.
2717
Whenever someone dramatically removes their necklace by just pulling it and it comes loose.
2718
Also, no guy actually knows how to tie a bowtie when theres a woman in the room.
2719
But all women somehow are born with this ability?
2720
Boy meets girl, boy annoys girl, girl hates boy, !
2721
they fall in love.
2722
A car's starter/battery is wholly unreliable in the woods, or when one is being chased by a serial killer.
2723
Love solves everything.
2724
People flying across the country on a whim and seemingly with no regard to ticket cost or personal finances.
2725
Guns.
2726
Everything about them is based on your not know how they work.
2727
Just picking them up and pointing them at someone and it makes all kinds of metallic noises.
2728
People who chamber a round in a shotgun/pistol for the "I'm so serious about killing you", when they should have had one chambered all along.
2729
When small women shoot large guns that appear to have no recoil.
2730
If you know anything about guns this should piss you off during movies too.
2731
Let's enhance.
2732
When characters hang up the phone and it goes right to dial-tone.
2733
Pulls out glock, racks a new round, CLICKS BACK THE HAMMER AND TURNS OFF THE SAFETY.
2734
Make my day!
2735
When broken marriages are fixed by an act of heroism (almost always on the man's side).
2736
The guy is still an asshole, lady, he still doesn't support you, just because he killed thieves in your house doesn't mean he's not emotionally abusive anymore.
2737
The running through airport security stunt.
2738
Shit like that is ridiculous.
2739
Title drops, where a character in the movie says the name of the movie.
2740
Kills it for me every time.
2741
Every time the late-20-something girl finally get to sleep with the late-20-something boy.but the only way we know this is because of the quick rolling-around-in-the-sheets montage and the next morning she's wearing his dress shirt with a few buttons undone.
2742
(This may be an overly-specific one, but my sister and I notice it constantly.)
2743
When someone sees a weird sex-position or reads a porn magazine/kamasutra and cocks their head/heads to get a better look.
2744
The wilhelm scream.
2745
I instantly get thrown back into the real world.
2746
Destroys the whole illusion.
2747
Most movies' portrayal of high school irks me.
2748
The new Spiderman movie was especially bad.
2749
Telephones: every number starting with "555."
2750
I know why, but it still snaps me into reality every time I see or hear it.
2751
Immediate dial tone when the person on the other end of the phone hangs up.
2752
Silencers which make the guns actually silent, or very close to it.
2753
Silencers are generally called "suppressors" and not "silencers" for a reason.
2754
An average "silenced" gun shot produces a sound measuring between 130 and 145dB.
2755
130dB is approximately equivalent to a sound produced by a 200-piece marching band.
2756
140dB is pain threshold.
2757
145dB is where your vision starts to blur because your eyeballs are vibrating from the sound waves.
2758
A gun with a suppressor does not sound like a baby duck farted.
2759
tl;dr: A "silenced" weapon is still loud enough that you should use ear protection when firing it.
2760
Sex.
2761
It just doesn't work that way folks.
2762
You do not just roll over when it is finished and go to sleep.
2763
and you definitely dont just put your clothes back on.
2764
There is jizz everywhere.
2765
Go clean yourselves you disgusting whores.
2766
You do NOT cuddle all night like that without waking up with the girls face plastered to your chest in a disgusting sweat.
2767
And you definitely do not kiss in the morning when you roll over.
2768
You would only encounter the most foul morning dragon breath that would only lead to more disgustingness.
2769
The fact that every story need a love side-story
2770
The unfortunate misunderstanding trope.
2771
The one that could be fixed by someone actually believing a loved one when they talk.
2772
You know: Love interest/best friend/parent/mentor: Oh my god, I can't believe you cheated on me/killed my mom/talked about me behind my back/used the science thing for evil/used the magical McGuffin you weren't supposed to touch/snuck out!
2773
How could you!
2774
Protagonist: But I didn't!
2775
Love interest/best friend/parent/mentor: But this person I don't know/someone I rarely talk to/person who obviously has a vendetta against you told me you did, thus you must have!
2776
Annoys the shit out of me.
2777
It makes people seem more petty and awful then they are for the sake of plot convenience.
2778
It's sickening.
2779
Michael Bay
2780
When a car door opens and it just shows the feet of the person getting out of the car.
2781
Like.
2782
It's too overused.
2783
Hey kids, we need to raise money to save the !
2784
I know!
2785
Let's put on a fair/concert/contest/etc and it'll look all big and professional and we'll print hundreds of full color posters and flyers and sell food and rent a massive stage with professional lighting and etc,etc,etc, with a budget that we never really discuss and is implied that it some how comes from, like, 6 parents of the kids.
2786
A comic sidekick that usually messes up gets it right at the movie's climax and somehow manages to save everyone.
2787
"I'm too old for this shit!"
2788
Sound and fire in space.
2789
see cabin in the woods
2790
The microphone feedback when the nerdy character goes to make a speech.
2791
When things could be solved or avoided if the protagonist would just take five seconds to tell the other person what happened or what's going on.
2792
IE: (Tentacle monster that main character accidentally summoned from another dimention pulls teen through door = screams and blood splatter) Secondary character: "Oh my god!
2793
What the Hell was that!" Main character: "I'll explain later.
2794
Help me find a flashlight!" ALSO.
2795
when people in a movie have never heard of the one common monster that is killing everyone in the movie.
2796
IE: Detective Shitforbrains: "I don't understand it Ed, this is the fifth victim we've found this week with these same puncture wounds on their neck and every bit of blood drained from their body?
2797
And the attacks only happen at night?
2798
Ed: "Looks like we got a psycho on our hands."
2799
i hate when characters call each other by name in the same scene.
2800
Once you start talking to a person, how often do need to say their name to them.
2801
It just starts to get weird, try it.
2802
Then don't get me started if they are family.every
2803
line of dialogue will start with with "Brother.this"
2804
or "Sister.that"
2805
and if they are talking to their parents.somehow
2806
it gets worse.
2807
"Father, why have you forsaken me, father?"
2808
But Father.
2809
Father you could.etc."
2810
i hate that.
2811
When someone gets a phone call, realizes who it is, then puts the phone down for like 5 to 10 seconds to tell somebody who's with them who they're talking to on the phone or why it's so important, then they put the phone back up to their ear and continue the conversation.
2812
Does the caller just go silent for 5 seconds and magically knows when the person they called is listening again?
2813
You just don't get it, do you!
2814
Bad guys not being able to shoot the good guy for the life of them no matter how big their gun is or how many of them there are, yet when the good guys shoot, they can't miss.
2815
Godfather II
2816
I always associate that style with cheesy movies from the '70's.
2817
They usually freeze with a loud horn hit or similarly funky music.
2818
I've come to the conclusion that unless we start killing senators and CEO's, we arent going to get anywhere.
2819
When that happens, you can find me on the battlefield.

It's a comic book fer crissake.
2835
What's next, a deconstruction of Cap'n Crunch?
2836
He's responded to this criticism a number of times already.
2837
From what I recall he essentially said a) he knows a lot more now about how difficult it is to make a good movie than he did when he started out reviewing, and so is more grateful when he sees one that isn't shit; and b) since all of his health problems he's basically so happy to still be able to watch and review movies, which he loves, that he's viewing them all with a more charitable eye.
2838
In fairness, while he has grown much softer over the last few years and has frequently given movies more than they deserve, I think something needs to be said about his actual rating scale.
2839
He doesn't consider the star ratings to be a measure of "objective" quality, a spectrum on which all movies of every kind appear; he rates each movie as a movie of its type.
2840
So he might give four stars to a dopey romantic comedy because it's really good at accomplishing what a dopey romantic comedy is supposed to do, which is have likable stars, good chemistry between them, and a lot of laughs.
2841
He might also give three stars to an Ang Lee film that is only pretty good at, you know, meditating about the nature of forbidden attraction and life and stuff.
2842
A lot of reviewers, and readers, will look at that and say "are you fucking kidding me? is better than ?"
2843
But that's not what he's saying.
2844
He's expecting them to be compared to movies like them, not held up as objectively Three-Star Movies.
2845
Keeping that in mind, I think, helps make his ratings a little more understandable.
2846
Not all the way understandable, though.
2847
There's basically no question he's gone soft, for the reasons he's addressed above.
2848
He keeps the poorly reviewed movies off his main page and under a heading simply titled "your movie sucks" That said, the list is brief and some of his recent reviews have been clunky and passive.
2849
Ebert has long been my favorite critic because he didn't care about what people thought of him, actually was a student of film, has no qualms with appreciating a pop movie for what it is and (usually) defends his rating in a detailed fashion.
2850
Even if I disagree with him, I still respect his stance.
2851
Furthermore, I can tell even from a poor review of his if I may still like a movie anyways (and vice versa) because of the ways he articulates his standing on the film.
2852
Sadly, those incredible reviews are getting fewer and farther between.
2853
It is a damn shame, because when he is putting his heart into a review, it really is a wonderful thing to read.
2854
All I can say is that the primary reason I love Ebert and ignore most other critics is that he genuinely seems to enjoy movies, and wants to enjoy them, even the ones that weren't created with his specific demographic in mind.
2855
He tends to give filmmakers the benefit of the doubt (which I feel is correct), unless its painfully obvious that they are ludicrously misguided, uninterested in the film's quality in favor of marketability, or intent on commiting an act of shameless manipulation or cruelty with their film.
2856
Too many critics are concerned with finding any arbitrary reason to tear a film down.
2857
I've written for several online and Chicago-based publications doing movie reviews.
2858
I see Ebert probably once a week, or once every other week, at screenings for upcoming films.
2859
I can assure you that he falls asleep at every single one of these screenings.
2860
I haven't done this professionally, but say in school, if I hadn't read a book for a class, I'd speak of it in a very middle-of-the-road way to find the path of least resistance.
2861
I can't speak for the man, but it wouldn't surprise me if this is what is going on.
2862
I hadn't thought about it before, but I think I agree with you.
2863
Even ignoring the stars, I'm looking over the actual in-depth reviews for a few movies and I think he's being far too soft.
2864
I have to tell you, though, I'm a little reluctant to even post this response because, y'know, it's Ebert!
2865
It's not like I'm better suited to review movies than he is, but I don't think his reviews are lining up with the quality of movies that are being released nowadays.
2866
Nothing makes his jaw drop anymore.
2867
I wouldn't call a 3 star review a good one but more a fine or ok.
2868
Yes, I think so too.
2869
But people change over time and their opinions change as well.
2870
I think he's in his 70's now and has survived a harrowing illness.
2871
That's bound to give someone a new outlook on life.
2872
Maybe his critiques are more easy going because movies are not as important to him as they used to be?
2873
http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,681657,00.html
2874
To be fair, he only goes to movies he wants to see nowadays.
2875
I don't know about his ratings, but Comcast has the 4 star rating.
2876
They give Gremlins 2 three out of four stars.
2877
Benchmark that to how they rate other movies, it gets pretty funny.
2878
And tbh, the fucking shot where Iron Man floats down and the entire team is standing back to back in a circle, and the camera circle arounds them as they get ready for the next wave.
2879
That is one of the coolest god damn shots in movie history.
2880
That is a great shot but my favourite has to be the uninterrupted tracking shot that follows each Avenger as they fight in the final battle.
2881
Hulk steal whole movie.
2882
Something I found very interesting is that over in r/comicbooks, everyone went nuts for The Avengers, but was sort of "meh" over Dark Knight Rises.
2883
The opposite is true here in r/movies.
2884
I imagine this is because the people who generally disliked The Avengers probably don't like comicbooks or superheroes that much, as it was more or less the first time someone wrote a story which could have been a comic, but made it into a movie.
2885
Dark Knight Rises was nothing like a comicbook.
2886
It was a movie that had characters slightly based on ones from a comicbook.
2887
It might be a good movie, but it was a shitty comicbook movie, IMO.
2888
Marvel went out and got Joss Whedon precisely because he is a comicbook guy.
2889
I once saw a quote by him along the lines of "I don't believe in transcending the genre; I believe in the genre."
2890
That is why The Avengers was awesome.
2891
I hate when filmmakers try and transcend the comicbook genre.
2892
Joss Whedon didn't try to do that; he just embraced it.
2893
Banner's "I'm always angry" line sealed the deal for me on 'Avengers.'
2894
I feel like the people who say this film is the most amazing film ever haven't really seen many movies to be able to make a critical comparison that warrants such a massive review as "most amazing film ever."
2895
This film was very well marketed, which made the hype incredibly powerful, even after the film was released.
2896
However, the film itself is nothing that stands out of the crowd of the many other films out there.
2897
Even the special effects were quite average and unimpressive for the budget given and the resources they had.
2898
A film with excellent special effects by Marvel's influence is "Thor," which utilized a massive array of innovative special effects in the CGI, compositing, and digital visual effects department.
2899
However, "The Avengers" did not nearly reach that level of sophistication in special effects, story, acting, or very much else.
2900
Was it a terrible movie?
2901
Absolutely not, but it doesn't deserve the cheering it has now by any means.
2902
Captain America ; either Hulk movie.
2903
The hulk movies are the worst of the extended continuity.
2904
"coolest god damn shots in movie history", thats a little far.
2905
I really enjoyed how each characters' unique personality was kept solid in the Avengers, and the interactions between each other was what made the movie great imo.
2906
Plus, the action was just awesome, straight up.
2907
Maybe i'm alone here, but i definitely wasn't impressed by the Avengers.
2908
It seemed very average and cheesy to me.
2909
I guess i'm not one to particularly like superhero movies, besides the Dark Knight trilogy.
2910
But to me the Dark Knight was so much more than a superhero movie, it had themes and commentary about actual people and the whole feel to it is so (pardon the cliche) dark.
2911
To me the Avengers was extremely mediocre compared to it, and mediocre as a movie itself.
2912
I wouldn't watch it again
2913
I thought the movie was kind of generic, personally.
2914
I didn't feel that it focused on the characters enough.
2915
It seemed like it was mainly about the heroes wailing on the 'bad guys', and periodically breaking it up with dialogue to inch the story/plot forward a little.I know the downvote storm is coming, but ah well.
2916
I didn't feel anything.
2917
In my point of view, it was a pretty mindless popcorn flick, and it really drags on the end.
2918
Though, I did love the relationship between Iron Man and the Hulk, and I liked how they captured Captain America's confusion with the state of our politics.
2919
Dark Knight Rises did something with one hero that Avengers can't touch on with six.
2920
Was I the only one who thought The Avengers was painfully average?
2921
A lot of CGI porn and not much else.
2922
5/10.
2923
The whole project was 10 years in the making.
2924
Care to elaborate?
2925
The first Iron Man movie was released back in 2008.
2926
Two years of (pre)production puts it at 6 years in the making.
2927
Unless, you are talking about the Hulk movie, which isn't part of the Marvel Ciniverse, if I recall correctly, just the Incredible Hulk.
2928
I was not impressed with avengers.
2929
It was okay but for taking 10 years and all the hype I was expecting a better movie.
2930
I'm curious how you can say Captain America is the weak film when Thor is part of the mix.
2931
I really enjoyed that shot of Cap through the car's side mirror.
2932
As an interesting sidenote: In 2007 I first got into entertainment reporting.
2933
Marvel were unhappy with Sony's treatment of Spider-Man after Raimi's 3rd and were looking to a new film studio.
2934
Paramount were interested, and were already working with them on Iron Man.
2935
Marvel really wanted to do an Avengers film and Paramount were open to that - but Marvel wanted it as the big four: Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, with one movie coming out each year building up to Avengers.
2936
Their plan was for each to get at least one film, leading to the Avenger finale.
2937
Paramount were on board for the Avengers flick but really disagreed on the characters, believing a Captain America film could not be a commercial success outside of the US given the strong anti-USA sentiments around the globe at that time, as well as believing most of today's youth wouldn't care enough about Thor and that a third Hulk film (Incredible Hulk was in pp by this stage) in a decade would be too many.
2938
This was an impasse which both sides refused to back down on.
2939
Then Universal, which was also in talks, shot itself in the foot with The Incredible Hulk and Marvel and Paramount reached an agreement where Marvel would up the % of profits Paramount received (to cover for the expected losses from Cap and Thor).
2940
which never ended up happening.
2941
It's pretty cool to see how the industry works at times.
2942
When in the world did I switch to /r/moviescirclejerk?
2943
The worst "Pre-vengers" movie was the Incredible Hulk.
2944
My initial interpretation of The Avengers was that it is the movie equivalent of fast good or pop music (the boy group type).
2945
That is, developed by producers and focus groups with the singular objective of making something that will be broadly popular.
2946
That's not necessarily a bad thing, though I am also thinking now that it is achievement in itself just how well it was done where so many other ambitious behemoth Hollywood movies have failed (Transformers, I'm looking in your direction Spiderman 3).
2947
So yes, I am in agreement that The Avengers counts as an enormous cinematic achievement even if it's not a sophisticated film itself.
2948
I wouldn't say it's a monumental achievement for film making at all.
2949
I'd say it's more of a great movie business and marketing achievement.
2950
None of the movies involved were great, and most were actually pretty bad.
2951
But they made MILLIONS.
2952
I thought they could have done with Hawkeye.
2953
It just annoyed me a little that you had the Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor doing the important work and then Captain America and Black Widow and Hawkeye saving like one bus of people in a city of millions.
2954
I loved it so much, and I hope they can recapture all of it for Avengers 2 and the other movies
2955
I am fascinated by popularity and ratings of this film, which I thought was mediocre at best -,-
2956
I think it's the best comic book movie ever made, it's a great adaptation of the characters and didn't try to make it "realistic" it showed awesome characters fighting aliens in an epic battle.
2957
The only problem I have is I found that they dumbed down the characters abilities.
2958
I watched the Avengers and was disappointed.
2959
I wonder if my expectations were too high!
2960
Why does everybody consider this movie hot shit?
2961
Me and my friends went to see it on launch and found it to be pretty bad.
2962
We didnt expect much as the other Marvel movies were also pretty bad.
2963
Especially Catpain America.
2964
Captain america was the best of the single hero movies
2965
I will say the film is an amazing achievement and agree with a great deal of what you are saying.
2966
However I have criticisms.
2967
-The alien bad guys.
2968
Could have literally been ANYTHING.
2969
Killer robots.
2970
Squids.
2971
Giant wasps.
2972
What they are has literally nothing to do with the end fight.
2973
Don't get me wrong, the worm things are cool, but the soldiers?
2974
And what's with them all being connected to the mothership like the droids from Phantom Menace?
2975
Silly.
2976
-The flying fortress.
2977
They spent all that cash on a flying fortress that could cloak and everything, yet one guy with a bow and arrow, and a couple of troopers arrive and manage to make it fall from the sky.
2978
It was neat, and a cool setting, but I'd rather it played a bigger role than; neat and a cool setting.
2979
-A wider issue with all Marvel movies to date: A bit inconsequential.
2980
It's fun, but at no point does it feel that there is any real danger of anything significantly bad happening.
2981
Which is fine - it's fun!
2982
But I'd like a little bit more substance to the drama.
2983
Actually Thor is the only film that managed this - the drama with his brother Loki and their fight at the end was the best ending of all the stand alone films specifically because the emotional connection the two had.
2984
It meant something.
2985
It's no coincidence that Loki is such an awesome part of Avengers.
2986
Great action film.
2987
And I was blown away by the action and a lot of the character interaction.However, upon second viewing, I found myself cringing at just how many plotholes and irrational character choices there are.
2988
In years to come, I doubt it'll have the cult following of some of the other Marvel/DC movies.
2989
The whole thing was an experiment in bring over the principals of comic book crossovers to movies.
2990
Every series is a movie into itself and every so often the characters all come together and interact in some epic scenario.
2991
I thought the only one that was actually a GOOD movie (as opposed to just being entertaining) was the first Iron Man.
2992
I liked it but killing Colson and then having Loki defeated so easily felt very contrived.
2993
Scarlett Johannsen's acting was bland but she doesn't exactly have to excite (see movie poster).
2994
It's an okay movie.
2995
Nothing much else can be said about it.
2996
Not really something that will trigger your mind afterward about the story itself or its theme.
2997
Just that they didn't fuck it up.
2998
I realized this movie was average when the dude died and i didn't give shit.
2999
Sure you can have great action but what makes great fight scenes is the story and emotion behind why things are fighting.
3000
Very true.
3001
They did a fantastic job at keeping the humor well written and not over-bearing like in alot of films.
3002
I give it a 9/10.and
3003
i don't ever give those out.
3004
There were some cheap one-liners I felt didn't need to be in it.
3005
Other than that minor gripe, I liked it.
3006
Meh, its not really my thing, I though the first Iron Man was a lot better.
3007
:/
3008
Capt.
3009
America: Stark!
3010
We need a plan of attackIron man: I have a plan, Attack Iron Man Isn't one of my favorite Marvel characters, But that was the best line in the movie for me
3011
Maybe it's because I saw it in 3D (rarely used properly IMO, certainly not here), or maybe it's because the fucking asshole in front of me was bumping his seat in my knees the whole movie, but I didn't enjoy it, and got bored that a huge part of the movie spoiler.
3012
I did love the final fight on Earth though, the Hulk for being that huge in all possible aspects (including Mark Rufallo nailing the part), and I also liked pretty much all of the characters movies (except for Iron-Man II which deserves a meh).
3013
All in all thanks to your post I will indeed give it a second watch in 2D and asshole-free, maybe then I'll agree with the rest of the Planet.
3014
not so ninja edits: spoiler and .
3015
After being exposed to Nolan's way of making superhero movies, and just the character Batman himself, I couldn't take this movie seriously.
3016
If it wasn't for the final fight at the end that was awesome, I would have hated it.
3017
I just think the characters are very cheesy and although they had movies that explained their origin stories, it still made them and all their lines just so tongue in cheek.
3018
Maybe Nolan just killed campy superhero movies for me.
3019
I dunno whether that's good or bad.
3020
I just hope a Justice League movie is just as good.
3021
On top of all that, Marvel sold themselves to Disney in the middle of all this WHAT!
3022
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
3023
Obvious marketing.
3024
Five day old account.
3025
Question: Why did Ironman lose consciousness if his suit is capable of retaining oxygen for breathing (as shown at the start where he is welding underwater)?
3026
It may be that he is wearing a different suit but why would you remove a useful feature.
3027
The suit also may have not been fully ready but the vital piece was in the helmet which was fully constructed and ready to rock.
3028
The reason the Hulk movies sucked outside of the actual dialogue on the script were because the Hulk's strength needs to be scaled.
3029
The Edward Norton hulk fights another hulk and they break Harlem.
3030
So what ?
3031
Why do I care?
3032
In The Avengers, we have Hulk and demigod Thor going fisticuffs.
3033
If Hulk were on land or a different surface could he had picked up Molijinir (SP ?)? Hulk punching that alien-serpent and stopping it in it's tracks show how much MORE powerful he is than the other Heroes.
3034
I mean, every super hero has super strength as an asset and the Hulk is supposed to trump all strength right?
3035
That's why he works so damn well in The Avengers IMO.
3036
The humor was incredible.
3037
It really put the hot fudge on the sundae.
3038
That scene, amazing.
3039
I think the greatest achievement throughout the process was that they got Kenneth Branaugh to direct Thor.
3040
That really is an odd thing.
3041
. Meh.Signed, McKayla
3042
The tie in with all the individual movies was well planned, and the final battle was a pretty epic action sequence.
3043
But all in all, it was still just a comic book movie.
3044
Albeit a very well done comic book movie, but it didn't transcend the genre in the way that Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy did.
3045
So I just flew on a journey across the world and back for a vacation, saw the movie three times on my onward and return legs, in addition to seeing it at the actual movies itself.
3046
Every comment from OP I agree with.
3047
Great great movie!
3048
5 movies for the main characters.
3049
It's awesome, plain and simple.
3050
People need to top knit-picking and just enjoy themselves.
3051
It's a movie that money makes.
3052
Other than that, artistically, and story-wise, it is not a monumental achievement in film, unless you are a teenage boy.
3053
It was, like someone else here said, pretty generic.
3054
It's an action film, no better or worse than something like Transformers.
3055
I mean just think about the big threat at the end.
3056
A nuke? How many times has that been done before?
3057
It was done in the most recent Batman film.
3058
That's for sure.
3059
Some better than others, but even at the worst of them, ( IMO Captain America.
3060
Just felt like it was sped through just to introduce the character and didn't develop as well as some of the other characters) Ummm, Thor?
3061
It was great minus that whole not having a plot.
3062
The whole no hero getting more time then the other kinda doesnt sit well with me.
3063
I feel like the hulk and iron man got most of the action, for instance captain america, Im a huge captain america fan, always have been always will be.
3064
and though I loved the scenes he was in he didn't seem to get that much time to shine besides the scene when him and iron man did that little 5 second combo and when he blocked that bomb by jumping up and blocking it with his shield.
3065
that was about it.
3066
I wouldve liked to see him a lot more in the movie
3067
Its was a decent film.
3068
I just don't feel Whedon beats out his action scenes properly, not inventive enough.
3069
Also as a Marvel fan it is difficult for me to divorce the cosmic cube from Mr. Fantastic.
3070
And Thanos well if the Infinity Gauntlet is ever revealed then not having the FF is just going to seem so wrong to me but I understand why the FF aren't in the film etc.
3071
The pacing is good.
3072
My favourite scene is when the sceptre affects everyone and they start in-fighting, the camera pans up and over showing that everything is being turned upside down/negatively affected.
3073
It was a nice little scene/shot.
3074
The spectacle is what gets people going but I just don't think it endears us to the characters abilities.
3075
I would have preferred Cap moving like Blonsky when he first goes up against the Hulk at the school and Hawkeye being a little more inventive with his shots and Arrow-heads.
3076
Don't even get me started about Widow.
3077
For me she just doesn't resemble the character in any true sense.
3078
I feel she should have been more Russian in a way that Anton Yelchin did in Star Trek, more authentic.
3079
EDIT: Oh and rating means it will never be serious enough for me but that's just personal preference I guess.
3080
That one scene where one of the baddies shoots randomly at some people and hits a wall ruined the verisimilitude for me a tad.
3081
You should join us at /r/comicbooks and post this there.
3082
Looking at the comments here I think we enjoyed the movie a bit more, similar to you.
3083
Totally agree, friend.
3084
If I could ever work on the writing staff of a movie, it would be this one.
3085
I can't wait.
3086
Anything coen bros
3087
This movie was almost part for part of the book.
3088
Ehhh Black Dahlia was pretty poor.
3089
It doesn't really excite me when he comes out with something new.
3090
hey thats not a movie!
3091
That whole segment in Spider-Man 2 when Tobey decides to ditch the costume and waltz around to "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" like a huge dork.
3092
I'm not saying he shouldn't have had that whole internal crisis, but the way they handled it was pretty awful.
3093
Could have been worse though.
3094
We could have gotten Emo Tobey like we did in Spider-Man 3. Fuck that movie.
3095
In the Dark Knight Rises, when Spoiler I literally laughed a bit in the theater when she did that.
3096
Near the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two, there is an incredibly unrealistic CGI backdrop as Harry wakes up from being unconscious.
3097
It was laughably bad CGI in a movie with otherwise great special effects.
3098
In the Dark Knight, when that swat guy in the truck cabin wouldnt shut the fuck up, in the underground chase.
3099
The movie 'Sunshine' anyone who's scene it will know the horror that comes about 3/4 the way in.
3100
Damn shame.
3101
The "Your pushing 60 and you've got a bum ticker" line in Sin City.
3102
The line itself is horrible and the way it's delivered by Michael Madsen made me want to fucking smack him.
3103
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which I'll grant you isn't a "great" movie, but it's a "pretty-good" kids movie, and in a world filled with appallingly brainless franchise cash-in animated features (unasked-for Lion King sequels, anyone?), it holds a small warm place in my heart.
3104
Anyway, there's a bit early on, before the flying-car-with-baddies action proper begins, when Sally Ann Howes sits in a swing and sings a soft-focus romantic ballad, "Oh What a Lovely Lonely Man", and when I was a kid and was watching it for the first time, I cringed.
3105
And when I was a mom and showing to my kids on video for the first time, I cringed.
3106
And I anticipate cringing when I show it to my grandkids.
3107
Because, the thing is, the movie isn't ABOUT the two adult protagonists and whether they manage to match up.
3108
The movie is ABOUT the flying car and bad guys, and when she sits in that swing and croons and swoons over Dick Van Dyke (major cognitive disconnect there, too, for all the grownups who grew up with him tripping over the ottoman, how does anybody swoon over Dick Van Dyke?), the whole movie simply grinds to a halt until she gets it out of her system and we can go back to the flying car.
3109
I can find the whole number explicable only by knowing that Sally Ann Howes was some kind of musical theater star in England, and that the movie had the Mary Poppins songwriting team on board, so obviously they felt it necessary to give her a big solo.
3110
Anyway.
3111
Thank goodness for video and DVD.
3112
You can fast-forward through that and miss nothing.
3113
I love Drive, but I can't stand Ron Perlman's horrible "pussy mobile" moment during the garage scene.
3114
Scott Pilgrim VS the World.
3115
I love that movie for its incorporation of music and vidya game graphics and sound effects.
3116
The first evil ex's dance/song/fight scene!
3117
Fucking awful.
3118
How did that guy get cast?
3119
Who wrote that awful song!
3120
High Tension (Haute Tension) the French thriller.
3121
Fantastic and frightening up until what may be the worst twist ever.
3122
(So bad it felt like the producer thought it up and demanded it.)
3123
The ending sequence (lame twists) of both Fight Club and American Psycho, the dream sequence in Rushmore, the board room scene in Muholland Drive, the retrieval scene in 2001, and the Plantation scene in Apocalypse Now Redux.
3124
Hitler did nothing wrong
3125
I'd like to see more versions of these for comparison, but to my eye (heh), the person looks most attractive with their natural color.
3126
(Of course, who's to say none of them wear colored contacts.)
3127
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (before he went crazy).
3128
Rotten Tomatoes is probably the best website to use, Metacritic really doesn't make a lot of sense and IMDB is terrible.
3129
Rope was shot in several hours.
3130
Actually, to tell you the truth, your unique situation with your brother sounds like it would make a great movie.
3131
The plot would revolve around the two of you fleshing out some of these ideas and attempting to make these movies.
3132
Seriously, it has a lot of crucial elements that would make it interesting to watch.
3133
A hint of "Be Kind Rewind" coupled with a less dramatic approach to a "Gilbert Grape" style story with the relationship between two siblings.
3134
(I mean no disrespect with this one, just the developmentally challenged aspect) I'd honestly love to see that movie.
3135
I would pay to see Tom Bodegas Bodacious Vacation.
3136
I think a few of those are based of off Goosebumps books.

Is the bottom right side even trying?
3152
What were they thinking putting both Indiana Jones sequels in the same bracket?
3153
I also disagree with some of the seeding (i.e.
3154
Wrath of Khan and Toy Story 3 should bee seeded higher, Fast Five and Rocky III should be lower).
3155
Predictions: 1st godfather pt.
3156
2/ empire strikes back/ 3rd either dark knight or terminator 2
3157
I definitely noticed that too.
3158
It seemed like a lot of things went wrong.
3159
Maybe it was orchestrated by the old gods.
3160
The fact that every other ritual also failed was unusual.
3161
They said that Japan has never failed before.
3162
And there just happened to be a girl in that classroom that knew a complicated ritual to dispel evil spirits?
3163
Maybe the apocalypse was just meant to happen that year.
3164
I got the sense that it was a joke that he smoked SO MUCH weed that it made him, and him alone, immune to the chemicals.
3165
I think the demo team just fucked up, but it was all in the same thread as the ominous opening, where the harbringer warned them of what bad was going to happpen.
3166
He was actually warning the tech people, not the college kids.
3167
loved the movie, but I also have something that bugs me.
3168
How would they not know the fool was still alive?
3169
Didn't they have heartbeat monitoring thingies in place?
3170
And when the dude pulled the lever to show the sacrifice for the fool was complete, wouldn't it not work or something?
3171
I am more curious as to why the old ones can't be sealed and imprisoned again.
3172
I thought the lack of tunnel collapse was a "power outage" which was caused by the fool (marty) messing about with the elevator whilst trying to figure out how to make it go down
3173
I never got the impression someone was trying to sabotage anything?
3174
Where are you getting this?
3175
The missing 'order' seems a sort of joke on the way they portrayed them as a normal business.
3176
I thought they said he became immune to the weed because he smoked so much of it.
3177
Yeah it's surrogates

I hate my brown eyes.
3185
This depresses me :(
3186
I have brown eyes and see no problems with either.
3187
Although the stars with dead-looking eyes like Zoe, look better!
3188
I never liked dead eyes.
3189
I have always been partial to brown eyes.
3190
Or Hazel.
3191
For some reason I usually associate blue eyes a lack of true emotion.
3192
Almost like nature made them to hide something.
3193
Just what my instinct has always made me feel.
3194
Multi-colored eyes are my favorite.
3195
I cant really see a good film being made about that, but who the fuck am I to doubt.
3196
Spielberg can do anything.
3197
Oh, fantastic.
3198
This will ensure that every American is an expert on EXACTLY what happened and we can all speak authoritatively about the topic.
3199
In Boogie Nights, his use of extreme close ups for Todd grabbing the keys and the "cocaine" really impact the scene.
3200
Also the first and last long tracking shots of the movie, and the last scene with Dirk.
3201
Rahad Jackson is probably one of the greatest minor characters ever conceived of and the One Last Thing segment gets me every time.
3202
I would say he is probably the biggest Kubrick fan-boy in the business.
3203
So many shots are ripped off pay homage to Kubrick, and it is no secret that PTA adored him.
3204
Watch and compare the first half hours of There Will Be Blood and 2001: A Space Odyssey, his use of the long take in Punch Drunk Love (and to some extent Boogie Nights) compared with the Shining (and perhaps Eyes Wide Shut).
3205
Also note that Kubrick was attached to a project called the Blue Movie about the first ever "big budget Hollywood porno", which, perhaps was motivation for Boogie Nights.
3206
I love PTA's style but it is fascinating to see the influence Kubrick had on him.
3207
If you're interested in comparing Boogie Nights with Goodfellas you might enjoy this post.
3208
is it wet hot american summer?

See, putting Christmas vacation up against the dark knight isnt fair.
3210
You are being forced to choose between the best batman sequel and the funniest christmas movies.
3211
They should have put Them against Rocky IV and Fast five or something.
3212
Just not fair to have to pick between those in the first bracket.
3213
I think the idea is great, but there are some obvious flaws with the rankings.
3214
L.A. Confidential should have ended when he says, "Show them your badge so they know we are cops."
3215
The end of Source Code.
3216
It should have stopped when they kissed on the train, leaving a sadder, but more appropriate ending.
3217
This is just my opinion of course, but I would have loved to have been left wondering just what Source Code really was, and what it could really do.
3218
I had a strong feeling at the end of TDKR that I would have felt much more satisfaction from seeing Alfred smile at something in the distance and then roll credits.
3219
I didn't need to see what he was smiling at because I knew what he was seeing already.
3220
In the Dawn of the Dead (remake) where C.J. blows up the bus.
3221
This is due to the fact that C.J. was easily one of the coolest characters in the movie and there's no way he could have died.
3222
Edit: Because he's awesome and invincible.
3223
Not because the explosion wasn't deadly.
3224
Instead of just driving away, Theo pulls over and watches through the trees to see what happens to Jasper.
3225
He puts the future of humanity at risk so that we get to see Michael Caine get shot from Theo's perspective through the trees.
3226
Perhaps the threat to humanity was the fact that throughout the movie we lost ours.
3227
Clive Owen, the hero, did not.
3228
Get him to the Greek.
3229
The three way scene was just so fucking weird that it threw off the entire movie for me.
3230
The ending of Drive: Spoiler
3231
How about that orgy scene from the Matrix Reloaded?
3232
It's still hard to watch that movie without that ".what the fuck did I just see?" feeling after that scene.
3233
Expendables 2 should have been over after the insanely badass opening scene.
3234
It was all downhill from there.
3235
The scene in Pulp Fiction with Bruce Willis and his annoying ass girl friend.
3236
Fuck your potbelly and your pancakes.
3237
Any other way of finding out his watch was missing would have been better.
3238
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when he sees Toby Maguire for the second time.
3239
I get my Raoul is petrified Christina Ricci will see / identify him, but could of done without him seeing Toby the second time.
3240
I hated the epilogue of the True Grit remake, it felt out of place and seemed to undermine a major theme of the movie.
3241
The last couple scenes in Mystic River I always felt were unnecessary.
3242
I have always thought the scene with Sean and Jimmy on the street would have been a much more poetic end.
3243
The very final seconds of knowing which was extremely underrated spoiler they show the kids romping around amongst the trees.
3244
They should have ended it right at the apocalypse much more depressing and powerful like the movie take shelter also a good flick.
3245
The opening monologue from Dark City (that explained the whole movie).I read somewhere the director's cut removed it.
3246
The last seconds of Paranormal Activity.
3247
When Ryan Gosling's character steals the mustang in Drive.
3248
One of my favorite detail about Driver, in the book, is that he always bought used cars for his jobs.
3249
He prefers bland cars that fade into the background and had powerful engines.
3250
He'll test drive it and check under the car, etc.
3251
Then he would have mechanics ".give it the works, new tires, oil and lube, new belts and hoses, a tune-up, then store it, where it would be out of sight till he picked it up for the job."
3252
Having him buy a car and fix it would have disturbed the pacing of the movie and he probably was pressed for time and didn't have a car ready to go, but I thought it would have been interesting to see another example of how meticulous and careful he is.
3253
Also they always steal cars in movies; it would have been refreshing to see something different.
3254
All three of the new transformers movies.
3255
The parts with the transformers, also the parts with the humans.
3256
The whole subplot with Mike whatshisname the asian guy Marge visits in Fargo.
3257
I mean, it developed Marge's character a little, but mostly it was just completely bizarre and didn't feel like it fit in with the rest of the narrative at all.
3258
All of the bizarre, cheesy, low-budget dream sequences in Brazil could stay on the cutting room floor.
3259
The coyote scene in Collateral when Shadow of the Sun starts playing.
3260
That threw the mood and tempo of the movie for a minute or two.
3261
You wanna talk it to death or run for office?
3262
Goodfellas and casino are on tv every other day and I stop and watch every god damn time.
3263
Raiders of the Lost Ark I could probably quote it in sync with the tv off by now.
3264
Many of his old movies are really bad and cheesy movies for today's standards, but had some of the best fight scenes he's ever done.
3265
Dragons Forever (1988) and Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars (1986) had Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao; they grew up training with each other in The Peking Opera School.
3266
If you don't want to watch a silly movie, definitely watch the fight scenes from those movies.
3267
Basically anything by Scorsese.
3268
But it really depends on the friend.
3269
Some are capable of understanding more in-depth films so I like to show them more complex films that require a brain and not just a pair of eyes.
3270
Half of the fun is the conversation after the film is over and listening to other people's opinions on what they thought the movie meant to them.
3271
Equilibrium (not too many familiar with it, excellent movie)Rock n Rolla Into the Wild Get him to the Greek
3272
Pro tip: if your girlfriend is not into action movies, show her Commando.
3273
She'll be so busy having fun, she won't notice that she's hopped into a new genre.
3274
Jurassic Park (1993).
3275
To me this still stands as the ultimate summer blockbuster.
3276
It showed me the magic and wonder of movies.
3277
There’s horror, action, science, a little drama, a little comedy, and in the end some warm family fun.
3278
It was the first and only dinosaur movie done right to this day IMO.
3279
And believe it or not there are still some people who haven’t seen it!
3280
Revolver directed by Guy Ritchie.
3281
It has Jason Statham in it so no one will think its too weird.
3282
Also, Guy directed movies like Sherlock Holmes and Snatch and Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.
3283
It's not really supposed to be an action movie imo.
3284
But it is badass indeed.
3285
It's also a lot like Fight Club without the cult aspect and a lot of people enjoyed that movie.
3286
Just off the top of my head, movies I showed my friends the first year of college: Memento, American Psycho, In Bruges, Once, Donnie Darko, Scent of a Woman, Pulp Fiction, There Will Be Blood
3287
The Big Lebowski Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels The Boondock Saints Across The Universe Grandma's Boy
3288
Toy Story, Star Wars, Terminator, Back to the Future, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, My Neighbour Totoro, Jurassic Park, E.T., Jaws and Die Hard.
3289
I wouldn't recommend anything too experimental or strange, of course.
3290
These are just some films that I think are quite good to ease someone in to the medium and give an okay variety as well.
3291
But, as said before it all depends on the person you are introducing.
3292
Horror go for 28 Days Later.
3293
Amazing film by Danny Boyle, great take on the zombie genre and has a level of horror that any level of moviegoer can appreciate
3294
I'd replace all actors and actresses with Nicholas Cage
3295
I'd replace Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese man in Breakfast at Tiffany's with Mickey Rooney playing Mickey Rooney.
3296
Not sure on Mickey's star power in the '60's but it would have been a fraction of what it was in the '40's and so I don't think it's entirely implausible that he would be living in a walk-up in Manhattan.
3297
Because his portrayal of a Japanese man placed a massive blemish on that movie.
3298
meg ryan in groundhog day BOOM.
3299
Hayden Christianson as Anakin with.
3300
well anyone else.
3301
I'd replace Clark, Lex, and Lois in Superman Returns with their Smallville actors, just for a fun little tie in, and because while Smallville kinda dragged on and got bland, the actors still did a really good job in the show's prime.
3302
Also, I HATED Kevin Spacey as Lex.
3303
Also, I think Topher Grace would've made a better Peter Parker than Toby McGuire.
3304
Topher also wasn't that great an Eddie Brock, I can't think of who I would've cast instead though.
3305
The Fifth Element:Jean Reno instead of Bruce Willis.
3306
Bruce Willis does it very well, but it feels like it was written for Jean Reno.
3307
Brad Pitt for Tom Cruise in Collateral.
3308
I'd replace Toby McGuire in everything he's ever done.
3309
Especially Spider-Man, which he fucking ruined.
3310
And yes, I mean Brothers as well.
3311
Ben Foster would have killed that role.
3312
Toby is a hanger for writers words and a bad actor, period.
3313
Fuck that guy.
3314
Replace every Tom Cruise movie with someone other than Tom Cruise.
3315
Top Gun with Brad Pitt?
3316
Yes, please.
3317
Mission Impossible with Leslie Nielsen?
3318
A thousand percent better.
3319
I'd have swapped Edward Norton in Fight Club with Brad Pitt
3320
Mr.& Mrs. Smith, Pineapple Express
3321
Rushmore (1998) or really anything by Wes Anderson Big Lebowski (1998) or other Coen comedies (Raising Arizona, Burn After Reading) I Love You Man (2009) and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) are two of the better comedies of recent years Wayne's World (1992)
3322
Lucky Number Slevin
3323
I agree with you, the original movies were pretty ludicrous to me as well.
3324
I remember one of them had them jump out of a plane in a fucking raft, and sliding in it down a mountain.
3325
It's not as bad people make it out to be, but it's pretty bad.
3326
Nothing wrong with the aliens part.
3327
And forgive me, it's been a while since I saw it.
3328
But there's a part where they go digging around in a graveyard and all of a sudden get attacked, completely at random by undead or some such thing.
3329
It made zero sense.
3330
There was no reason to make it.
3331
Indiana Jones was a fantastic trilogy, and this movie put a big fat blemish on the series.
3332
It isn't a good movie.
3333
Even if you look past the Fridge Nuking and the Aliens, it still just isn't a good movie.
3334
And that's the most important part.
3335
Most excellent!
3336
I never got the "What number are we thinking of?" "69 dudes!" joke as a kid.
3337
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3fx6TugN7g so excited for a new one.
3338
Wait, WHO will play Rufus?
3339
EXCELLENT!
3340
. I'm definitely not ever watching shit like this sober again.
3341
It does
3342
So, uh, anyone have a clue as to why they have a shotgun trained on him?
3343
The sequence in the bar with the gila monster kills me every time
3344
We've been rango'd
3345
As an animator I absolutely love this.
3346
The animators on this film did such a good job of using the reference footage to capture Johnny Depp yet push his acting so much further and created an amazingly appealing and quirky character.
3347
Absolutely gorgeous film.
3348
One thing that made my jaw drop was the amazing detail of the glass bottles you see in the film.
3349
I refuse to believe that it was all animated, they looked so real.
3350
By any chance does the OP have more where this came from?
3351
Truly an amazing animated movie.
3352
I watched Rango while I was quite baked with a friend of mine.
3353
When it got to the part in the bar where Rango swallows that cigar, follows it up with some kind moonshine, and proceeds to burp fire all over that weird eel dude I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.
3354
I tried to control myself as I was way more stoned than my friend and didn't want to interrupt the film.
3355
turns out he had to stop it and rewind it to watch that part again, and then had to pause it for about five minutes while we tried to take in the hilariousness of what we had seen.
3356
watched it again when we were sober, it was still funny.
3357
great movie, quite weird, but good.
3358
Beautiful film and the standoff between Johnny Depp Vs Bill Nighy was epic, shame there is no clips anywhere i can find that are good.
3359
The shotgun was necessary for his method acting as a gecko?
3360
Did they have to do it at gunpoint?
3361
Johnny Derp
3362
Johnny Depp is an exhausting figure.
3363
Enough is enough already.
3364
Musta been really cold in that studio.
3365
As an animator, when I see solid acting reference that goes along with the dialogue.
3366
I love it so much.
3367
Johnny Depp you're an animators best friend.
3368
3
3369
Are they pointing a gun at him?
3370
Anyone else wondering why the arms don't follow Depp's before he throws them out?
3371
So, is this actually how they film these animated movies?
3372
I've always wondered.
3373
Great flick!
3374
Yup lot of Depp screamin in this movie.
3375
Looks like Johnny is dancing in front of a shotgun.
3376
Why is Johnny Depp needed for that particular animation?
3377
I would think that any stand-in could produce the desired movements.
3378
I would pay money to see that film, they show a little bit in the special features but I wanna see the whole movie like that!
3379
Any more info about this?
3380
There's no tracking markers or anything, so there's no way they're tracking his motion in the first one.
3381
Love this movie.
3382
I appreciate it more every time I see it.
3383
11/10 would bang (Johnny, not Rango)
3384
is that a gun?
3385
Was Isla Fisher holding the gun?
3386
It was a good movie, I just hated how easy they made it for the main characters to escape from that water tank of sorts.
3387
I mean seriously, a coughed up bullet floating forward at a snail's pace is what shatters their watery prison?
3388
Rango was a fantastic movie.
3389
My kids are watching this on heavy rotation.
3390
They will love the gif.
3391
Great find!
3392
This is why he is the fucking man.
3393
I wanna see Bean do this
3394
Rango was great!.
3395
Needs more Helena Bonham Carter
3396
Since this got relatively little feedback, I would try /r/tipofmytongue.
3397
They love this kind of stuff.
3398
False equivalencies.
3399
The company (probably) did not willfully commit a crime.
3400
At best they are guilty of negligence -- thus the fine.
3401
The student knew downloading songs was illegal and did it anyways.
3402
The imbalance of justice is staggering.
3403
However, the example extends false reasoning to criticize it and is thus a compromised argument -- that intellectually interested parties should not use in defending their pro-"reduced fines for pirating" stance.
3404
It sounds vaguely like the old Ernest Borgnine movie Marty.
3405
At first I found this news depressing but now that I've read the script review linked in that article, I'm actually really glad that it may not be happening.
3406
It sounds fucking terrible.
3407
No wonder Aronofsky jumped ship so quickly, seems as if there's no room for artistic expression.
3408
MGM seems to want it to be a by-the-books action movie with franchise potential.
3409
The original and its sequels/spin-offs weren't exactly cinema gold to begin with.
3410
Honestly if it happens or not I highly doubt it can or will be viewed as good (on par) with the first.
3411
Robocop had an eerie tone throughout the whole show and had many shocking scenes that didn't rely on gimmicks or cliches.
3412
Any modern edition would simply be ripe with all kinds of things we've seen already.
3413
Now, if they decide to re-make the #2 and 3 and pretend the those didn't happen I'd probably be more than happy.
3414
Good.
3415
I think I'm infinitely more interested in seeing what the new interpretation of Robocop looks like then of seeing an actual movie.
3416
He's so iconic a character I just can't picture anything that could live up to it.
3417
District 9 has cliches, they're just videogame cliches.I would argue that all movies have -some- level of cliches.

My reaction: YES!

Don't know why, just part of our routine I guess.

Not that we actually watch it, more for noise than anything.

Anchorman - Will Ferrell's finest IMO Dumb and Dumber - The "dumb" lines are so smartly written, it's truly like an art.
3536
The only other movie I've seen that nears that is Zoolander.
3537
Shaun of the Dead, if not for the quality of the movie then for the massive amount of little bits that you don't catch the until 2nd 3rd or 6th time.
3538
There's always some subtle joke to catch.
3539
Snatch.
3540
No other movie is as quotable for me as that one.
3541
There are movies that are better than it, but as far as one that I can always put on and enjoy whatever my mood is, it's Snatch.

The last time I saw that movie I was on acid and had the sound off with music playing.
3560
The first few minutes I thought that this was a terrible idea and we're all gonna have a bad trip.
3561
By the end of the movie we all agreed that it was the best thing we could have ever done.
3562
definitely a "well, i know what i am doing for the next hour and a half" movie.
3563
so ridiculous
3564
There should be a sequel that is just a therapy session for the entire family.
3565
The boy is living with his fathers killers, but his father did also killed their son/brother, but then again the kids dead father did dress up as his step dad and fuck the step mother.

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World with Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly.
3578
It's not that it was bad, it was 10x better than expected.
3579
When the movie ended, i cried for 20 minutes solid.
3580
No exaggeration.
3581
I was super depressed for a week after seeing it.
3582
Which Dune are we talking about?
3583
The sort of mini series that was on like three different disks?
3584
Cause the other one was pretty bad if i remember correctly.
3585
All Shook Up maybe?
3586
Just a random guess :P
3587
Yeah, no.
3588
Probably 'Gone With The Wind'.
3589

Mark Kermode - don't always agree with him, but he's often funny & he knows his stuff.
3591
He has a radio show with Simon Mayo on the BBC every Friday.
3592
Ebert is generally good, but his scores don't necessarily reflect the quality of the film.
3593
Myself.
3594
Hey look, it's Todd.
3595
From the teaser trailer's premiere, I've been nothing but anxious to see this film.
3596
I can already tell that this is going to be one of the best, if not the best, of 2012.
3597
Thanks!
3598
Paul Thomas Anderson+Joaquin Phoenix+Philip Seymour Hoffman+music by Jonny Greenwood=(what might be)the best movie of the year
3599
When i read the title, i expected a trailer for the Doctor Who master.
3600
The drumming only led me farther into the belief.
3601
Anyways, looks like a good movie.
3602
i cant wait.
3603
I love everything PTA has done so far.
3604
All I heard that whole time was "thump-thump-thump-thump.thump-thump-thump-thump."
3605
I thought it was going to be about something completely different!
3606
Please go see this.
3607
I was lucky enough to be the Aero crowd who got to see it.
3608
It's soooo worth it.
3609
It's beautiful and a really gripping experience.
3610
You'll love it if u loved There Will Be Blood.
3611
If anyone is curious what the piece in the trailer is, it's Isle of the Dead by Rachmaninoff:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N10YZ2Sk3Kg
3612
Even though the production company officials have denied that the film was loosely based on L. Ron Hubbard.
3613
Seeing this trailer, it is really hard not to see how this film will be analogous to the creation of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard.
3614
Gosh, that looks terrific.
3615
Good to finally see a full trailer, can't wait.
3616
Upvote for a kick ass username
3617
im so sick of the trailers and teasers of this hyping it up like an action suspense thriller, when everyone who has seen it says it is a cerebral, non-crowd pleasing film.
3618
it is like they are trying to sell it as something badass like prometheus

If someone made a sequel to Donnie Darko which I then watched, and it ended up being the worst movie i'd ever seen.
3628
Then I would un-see that.

Fortunately no such film exists.

Chucky, that way I wouldn't have this irrational fear of dolls.
3651
LOTR.

In final analysis I just didn't like Jackson's adaptation, and I now wish I could enjoy the novels without his imagery in my head.
3653
Dinner for Schmucks.
3654
I had semi-decent expectations going in because I generally like most of Steve Carell or Paul Rudd's stuff.
3655
Jemaine Clement was the only reason I didn't leave my seat.
3656
It was just too over the top and the jokes were just not funny at all.
3657
Duets.
3658
It's hard to tell if Gwyneth Paltrow is trying play her character as mildly retarded on purpose, or if it just ended up looking that way.
3659
Plus it's about karaoke.
3660
And Huey Lewis is in it.
3661
Glitter is also a reason to self-induce blindness.
3662
But it's Citizen Kane compared to Duets.
3663
"The Hillz" EDIT: If you saw it, you'd know.

3680
Kiss Kis Bang Bang, watch it once, then again with the commentary.
3681
Kilmer is ridiculously funny in the commentary!
3682
Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
3683
Dredd has the potential to be awesome, this movie may or may not achieve that (i hope so but i have my doubts) but either way i hope lots of people go to see it.
3684
A successful Dredd movie would mean that we get more Dredd movies, and eventually one of them will nail it, if not this time around then when it is rebooted.
3685
What was weird about it to me was that I had literally just watched The Raid (or The Raid: Redemption as they rebranded it for the west) and it was like I was watching a higher production value, futuristic version of that same movie when I saw the new Dredd Trailer.
3686
So basically, you don't like Slow-mo or 3D.
3687
gotcha.
3688
im in
3689
I know it was a feature in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" (1966), but I doubt that was where it originated.
3690
A good question, though.
3691
Sorry I can't help more.
3692
HUGO STIGLITZ
3693
My best guess would be that it originated in silent movies.
3694
Probably the villains were introduced like that.
3695
This is from wikipedia's freeze frame shot article.
3696
It's the best I could find on Google in 2 mins.
3697
A very memorable freeze frame is the end of François Truffaut's The 400 Blows, a New Wave film from 1959.
3698
Director George Roy Hill frequently made use of the technique when depicting the death of a character, as in The World According to Garp (1982) and in the memorable ending to the classic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), with Paul Newman and Robert Redford.
3699
I really didn't care about the whole trees killing people thing.
3700
What pissed me off was the dialogue and acting.
3701
It was just retarded how people communicated with one another in that movie.
3702
Also, that scene when they're supposed to be running away from the wind.
3703
just stupid.
3704
Yah, nah, that movie was garbage.
3705
Nice try M. Night Shamyland
3706
It should have been called "What's happening?".
3707
What! No!
3708
Even if everything you said was totally valid and M night was really making a deep point (which i really dispute), it would still be a piece of shit, horrible movie.
3709
Honestly, if a movie infuriates and confused critics and mass audiences worldwide for years, then the filmmaker did not make a good movie.
3710
Most of the time the fault of an audience not "getting" a movie is the fault of the filmmaker, not the audience.
3711
The forefront example: Primer.
3712
Usually they trade in clarity in an attempt to mind-fuck, shock, confuse, or otherwise frustrate the audience for their own intellectual high-horseyness.
3713
tl;dr: If your movie needs a chart or detailed, reaching explanation to convince your audience what they just watched wasn't terrible, chances are (and, of course, there are exceptions) you failed as a filmmaker.
3714
Wow, you shed a whole new light on this movie for me.
3715
I may actually watch it a second time.
3716
The one thing I really liked about the movie, aside from the story line, was the cinematography.
3717
He shot some beautiful yet unsettling scenes.
3718
This movie explained very little and was a little too open ended.
3719
It made for a movie about people acting (badly) terrified of plants or gas or something.
3720
The Happening is a bad movie with a silly plot.
3721
The only way I could watch it was the Rifftrax version.
3722
What sucks is the intensely shitty acting, terrible and non-believable scenarios the characters would end up in that weren't interesting, and the fact that it has no tension or suspense for a god damn second.
3723
Why you eyein' my lemon drink?
3724
I always thought the film operated very well as a red-scare style 50's and 60's b-movie sci-fi horror
3725
If this is what he was going for, he should have left it completely unexplained in the end.
3726
No trees, nothing.
3727
TL;DR but that movie is shit.
3728
This was a terrible movie.
3729
No amount of mollycoddling will change how badly it was made.
3730
you describing it is making me watch it for my first time right now i will let you know what I think :)
3731
I enjoyed it too.
3732
But what do I know?
3733
Up vote!
3734
What Shyamalan is saying in this movie.
3735
You can't speak for Shyamalan!
3736
How do you know that is what he was "saying?"
3737
You don't, and to pass your opinion off as his thoughts is unscrupulous.
3738
Why I do think the movie as a whole is pretty awful (mainly due to Marky Mark), I think he was talking about how humans are destroying the Earth with their carelessness.
3739
The Happening is far from horrible.
3740
Sure its not that good either and falls into what i consider mediocre, but its far from awful.
3741
I'd rather watch Happening over and over again than Twilight or Avatar.
3742
It had a couple of well done death sequences and I didn't find it that confusing or dull.
3743
Nature got pissed, decided to show humanity who is really in control of the planet and then when it felt its point was made it stopped.
3744
I don't see why that's so hard to figure out.
3745
Great explanation.
3746
Now, I have been a longtime fan of M. Night Shyamalan and even I know that this movie is very flawed in terms of some of the dialogue and overdramatic moments.
3747
However, what this movie lacks is made up for in the, as you pointed out, mysterious ambiguity of what is actually happening and some of the really really tender and beautiful moments in the film.
3748
It also has some bizarrely eerie moments that people just write off as pure humor (such as the scene in the model house and all the scenes in the old lady's house) but which I personally think is just the very odd and unsettling atmosphere Shyamalan is trying to establish.
3749
In any case, despite some bad acting it also has some really really heartbreaking scenes that are superbly acted - the one that stands out is when Julian says goodbye to his daughter as he gives her to Elliott and Alma.
3750
Beautiful.
3751
Basically I agree that this movie is severely underappreciated in terms of purely beautiful moments and the oddly mysterious undertones Shyalaman attempts to establish.
3752
There has to be a better way to send that message.
3753
"Holy cheese and crackers."What
3754
a pile of shit.
3755
My favorites are drunken master and first strike, but his latest, the shinjuku incident, was very good too.
3756
Rumble in the Bronx will go down as his all time best movie and will remain a timeless classic.
3757
Definitely First Strike.
3758
With Rumble in the Bronx as a close second.

Rushmore
3767
Watched an old black and white movie called "Eraser Head" with a scene that had a woman with puffed out cheeks, dancing on a stage and singing about heaven while little sperm alien looking things fell and she squished em.
3768
To this day I still don't get the point of the movie.
3769
The troll from "Ernest Scared Stupid" gave me some pretty intense nightmares.
3770
I'm 24 years old now and I still can't muster up the courage to rewatch it for fear that the nightmares might return.
3771
It, with the whole clown in the sewers bit does it for me.
3772
Until I was about 15 or so I was scared sh*tless by the R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents Of Unusual Size).

I guess it's not a perfect answer to the question, but who could live a fulfilling life without watching The Princess Bride! (Also, Mrs. Doubtfire.)

I do seriously love the endings of Pulp Fiction and TDKR (I also loved Batman Begins with the Joker card at the end.the

perfect segue).
3780
But to be a totally cliche girl, I LOVE the ending of Breakfast at Tiffany's.

3782
Predator (the original), though Predators is a pretty great follow up.
3783
It’s probably challenging because most popular publications are in the business of parroting what the studios want them to and hyping upcoming productions.
3784
There’s little room for truly critical voices in most major media outlets for two reasons, either they are owned by the same corporate monolith (think Viacom) or the success of journalistic publications that focus on the film industry is dependent on the relative success of the film industry itself (what’s good for the goose is good for the gander).
3785
I’m sure that if you looked to some of the more critical film journals (read: academic) that you would find what you are looking for.
3786
Film Criticism, published by Allegheny College in Pennsylvania is an example of a possible source as is Film History which is published by the Indiana University Press.
3787
As to my own thoughts on the current state of the industry –major American films have been steadily declining in quality and content since 1975 with the emergence of the blockbuster film (think Jaws, Star Wars, etc.) that destroyed the experimentalism of the New Hollywood era of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s (think Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, The Godfather, etc.).
3788
Hollywood has come to rely on “tent-pole?
3789
films to carry studios through each production year and because those films need to appeal to as broad an audience as possible to even dream of recouping their production and advertising costs, they tend to be geared towards a wide demographic.
3790
This is not bad in and of itself it just means that there’s less room for niche material or for untried or unproven ideas ?
3791
hence the reliance on reboots, remakes, tie-ins from other products (video games, books, etc.).
3792
Not all niche movies are great and not all blockbusters are bad it just means that less voices are heard and fewer new ideas see the light of day which I think is detrimental to the industry overall.
3793
Right now, the most original programming in moving pictures is being produced on cable, specifically, premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime but also by other content creators like A&E.
3794
I think this is due to the fact that cable can reach a smaller, more targeted audience, the production and marketing costs are lower (thus the risk is lower) and producers are more inclined to take chances (would a movie about cancer patient who turns to manufacturing methamphetamine been a hit on the big screen?).
3795
Now there are examples the same ideas being retread on cable (zombies, vampires, etc.) but often those shows are finding new and interesting ways to reach a different audience or “say? something different than their big screen counterparts.
3796
Until moviegoers stop handing over hard earned money for broad, unoriginal movies and we see more studio push backs and delays which result in major financial losses (think the recent GI Joe debacle) we’ll continue to see the same schlock rolled out every summer.
3797
There are great filmmakers working in Hollywood today but the entire climate is risk averse for the reasons outlined above.
3798
Things are ripe for a similar experimental period like the New Hollywood era in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s or the rise of the “independent?
3799
cinema in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.
3800
If we’re on a 20 year cycle then I think we’re due soon!
3801
The Mexican standoff at the end of The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is my favorite ending sequence.
3802
The framing, the editing, actors faces, the score, everything builds to an amazing climax.
3803
I don't think a scene has ever been this operatic and pulled it off.
3804
And it won't ever be topped, in my opinion.
3805
Its as cinematic as it gets.
3806
Gangs of New York.
3807
Watching Manhattan rise into the sky while the cemetery is overgrown and forgotten really gets me.
3808
I'm very nostalgic I suppose.
3809
The Mist.
3810
Once Upon a Time in the West - a long ending sequence including: the station being built as the train tracks arrive, the gun battle between Bronson and Fonda (where we finally learn why Bronson was looking for Fonda) and the death scene for Jason Robards.
3811
Epic in every way.
3812
The Squid and the Whale.
3813
Pulp fiction, just because the movie blew me away the first time I saw in the theatre
3814
There Will Be Blood.
3815
"I'M FINIIIIISHED!"
3816
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
3817
Se7en.
3818
Just an epic scene all around.
3819
Michael Clayton instantly comes to mind
3820
"After this, my guess is you'll never hear from him again."
3821
Or something like that
3822
It's not quite the final shot, but near the end of "Once Upon a Time in the West" when Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson face off is just amazing film making, and the soundtrack for the whole movie is art in one of it's finist forms.
3823
Jesse Eisenberg.
3824
Sure he's oscar-nominated, but I would seriously rank him as one of the best actors of all time and most wouldn't.
3825
Michael Madsen gave one of the greatest performances of all time as Mr. Blonde.
3826
He's done fuck-all since then, unfortunately, but damn.
3827
Geez, the entire cast of Breaking Bad comes to mind
3828
Anything by Werner Herzog, especially the films he did with Klaus Kinski.
3829
F.W Murnau films such as Nosferatu, Faust, The Last Laugh, and Sunrise.
3830
Then there is Fritz Lang who did Metropolis, M, as well as numerous others.
3831
Other good ones would be Wings of Desire and Good Bye Lenin!.
3832
I'll also throw Rainer Werner Fassbinder's name in the shuffle.
3833
The Lives of Others.amazing!
3834
Das Boot, Der Untergang, Die Fremde.
3835
Die Welle - A film about "a high school teacher's unusual experiment to demonstrate to his students what life is like under a dictatorship" Soul Kitchen - A funny film about a restaurant Das weiße Band - A film about a small village in the north of Germany during the years just before World War I And Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens is a silent film, so it doesn't help you with your language skills, but it's worth to watch, nevertheless.
3836
Run, Lola run Stalingrad Downfall
3837
Pretty much anything by Michael Haneke.
3838
"Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei" "Lammbock" Stoner Comedy "Tattoo" looks and feels a lot like Seven "Hell" "Tatort: Weil Sie böse sind."
3839
"Napola" Silent Movies: "Das Cabinet des Dr Caligari" "Der Golem" There is an amazing Version out there with soundtrack done by the Dandy Warhols
3840
I can recommend Aguirre: The Wrath of God, an excellent Herzog film with Klaus Kinski as a psychotic conquistador leading a doomed expedition up the Amazon.
3841
I also enjoyed Downfall, which is about Hitler's last days during the battle of Berlin
3842

Forest Whitaker.
3847
Tony Todd!
3848
He made the Night of the Living Dead remake.
3849
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ralph Fiennes
3850
Kevin Spacey and Paul Giamatti I pretty much disagree with everyones comments so far, everyone that has been named have had a good deal of starring roles and are very appreciated actors
3851
Gary Oldman
3852
The lucky quarter gas-station conversation from No Country for Old Men has no blood, no gore, no violence even, and yet it is bone-chilling.
3853
Is that the guy from Ghostbusters 2?
3854
The "what's in the box!" scene at the end of Seven.
3855
Felt so bad for the character, havent watched the movie again.
3856
Edit: i think the scene hit me so hard because i watched it around the time i was getting serious with my then girlfriend/ now wife and i couldnt imagine the pain of losing a significant other in that gruesome of a way.
3857
Spoilers: There are two scenes that I widh I could unsee.
3858
The underpass rape scene and the end scene where the dude beats the rapist with a fire extinguisher until its nothing but mush.
3859
All of this happens with the camera never turning away.
3860
This scene from I saw the devil.
3861
Ignore the music, copyright laws and such, but anyways this rustled my jimmies because of how desperate the driver looks once it starts, the look on his face as he knows his time is near.
3862
Fucking freaky.
3863
That awkward moment in mallrats when silentbob crashes in on gwen in the changing room.
3864
His face lights up with joy and confusion.
3865
This man has reached the promised land.
3866
It was an accidental meeting of souls, but he gets punched in the face and called a pervert with disgust.
3867
Alas, cruel fortune.
3868
A few of what i would consider science fiction-Donnie Darko -Back to the Future Trilogy (Goes without saying) -Moon -Wall-E -Twelve Monkeys -K-Pax (sorta sci-fi) -The Fountain -Starship Troopers -Super 8 -War of the Worlds just a few on top of a bunch that you already named.
3869
Hope this helped you out.
3870
Enjoy
3871
The special features on the Game of Thrones season 1 blu-rays are amazing.
3872
I mainly enjoy it because it has a ton of lore from the books that aren't in the show.
3873
I've spent an entire weekend watching nothing but the extra features for it.
3874
Anchorman is really good, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back too.
3875
The special features of Predator are amazing too!
3876
What do you mean by "a short amount of time," exactly?
3877
Iron Man 3!
3878
1.) I read the title at first as Emma Watson should co-host, fuck what reddit does to my mind 2.) Fuck the U.S government
3879
The rich aren't money machines.
3880
If you start taxing the hell out of them, their motive to produce is reduced.
3881
If you make approximately the same amount of money but only have to do 75% of the effort, why would you push the extra 25%?
3882
Granted, some still will and others aren't exerting themselves at all to be rich.
3883
The point still stands.
3884
Taxing people at a higher rate will not necessarily bring in as much tax revenue as expected.
3885
This article is so poorly written and calculated it is embarrassing.
3886
The author is fundamentally wrong in the top 10% income tax rate The author shows a fundamental misunderstanding in how corporate taxes work.
3887
Additionally, the author gets the amount of individuals wrong on the $110k or greater number as well as confuses what $110k taxpayer actually is.
3888
and avoids the cost of living.
3889
Adding 6.2% in federal taxes to that bracket moves them up to 46% federal rate, which is beyond punitive.
3890
The never been taxed element of the death tax comment is intellectually dishonest.
3891
And finally, the Financial Transaction Tax was so clearly punitive to the middle class, anyone with a brain stopped promoting it.
3892
The debt is paid off, not the deficit.
3893
The deficit is merely spending minus revenue.
3894
To define "taxes avoided", one must first establish a "normal" level of taxes.
3895
What, in your opinion, is a normal taxation level?
3896
When balancing your own personal budget, do you find it easier to do so by reducing your spending or by increasing your income?
3897
The same applies to the government; they are not living within their means.
3898
I say repeal the entire tax code, and replace it with a flat sales tax and maybe a flat import tax.
3899
We could balance the budget at 17% and pay off the entire national debt in under a decade if we cut unconstitutional spending immediately.
3900
Rabble rabble rabble
3901
Well, whatever helps you guys sleep at night.
3902
Look guys, I hate to toot my own horn here but I am from America.
3903
I am from the single greatest entity to ever exist in the history of time, period.
3904
Therefore I am a part of the number one country in the world (at everything).
3905
Everyone should just work way way harder and then everything will be fine again.
3906
trust me.
3907
America #1
3908
It's actually taxes avoided by everyone.
3909
If everyone paid their taxes our budget would be balanced.
3910
But yes the lions share come from wealthy people because they, obviously have more to pay.
3911
Debt and deficit don't matter.
3912
This will go over like a lead balloon.
3913
In all fairness, strip clubs arn't considered pornography.
3914
Porn must be either print, video, or web.
3915
Much the same as gay sex only counts if democrats engage in it.
3916
First they lose the women's vote with rape and abortion.now
3917
they are trying to lose the male vote with pornography.
3918
"Smaller Government", my ass.
3919
This is war against pleasure.
3920
Only because they lack the willpower to stop looking at it.
3921
And every male teenager in America.
3922
" and members of the male race everywhere."
3923
This priebus character has the most punchable, smirking snide snotty face I have seen on a politician in a long long time Both him and Romney are some of the most unlikable characters the Republican Party has discovered, ever
3924
Loved the last exchange: MATTHEWS: Let me tell you some history, sir.
3925
Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt pushed for that, Truman pushed for that, were they all under the influence of Europe?
3926
Where do you get this from?
3927
PRIEBUS: I’m not going to get into a shouting match with Chris, so you guys can just move on.
3928
MATTHEWS: Because you’re losing, that’s why.
3929
Holy shit, the dunks keep on coming.
3930
Matthews has always had a ball busting streak to him but combine that with AC and Soledad calling out GOP bullshit re: medicare.
3931
It's almost like some journalists are doing their fucking jobs again.
3932
Obama should come out and make some joke about 'At least nobody asks me if Michelle is my only wife.'
3933
And then when the right starts going ballistic, simply say, 'I thought we were joking now!
3934
Where's your sense of humor?' I'm sure they'd understand.
3935
So to refute that they haven't been calling Obama a foreigner, he claims everything Obama does is inspired by foreigners?
3936
LOL.
3937
Chris wins this round.
3938
Flawless victory.
3939
I like how Priebus can straight up lie to the camera with his eyes-half-closed forced smile and pretend like he is good at it.
3940
He knows the GOP has been running a dirty game this entire time, and yet he tries to make it seem like Matthews is the chump for EVEN SUGGESTING what the actual truth is- like a how dare you accuse me of the things I have been doing, everyone knows I'm allowed to do whatever I want even if I get caught!
3941
His intellectual dishonesty is astounding.
3942
The fact is, people like Priebus is what is wrong with this country.
3943
Nationalist crazies who don't or simply won't comprehend that there is an entire WORLD out there, full of ways of doing things that just might be BETTER than the way we do things.
3944
Our health care system is an absolute disgrace, it is a sick care system and an emergency care (but only if you can afford it, if not please see yourself out and go die) system.
3945
We SHOULD be looking to other countries for guidance on how to do it better, and let go of the completely outdated and wrong notion that the US has the "best in the world".
3946
We just don't.
3947
We don't, don't, don't, don't.
3948
Its time to get over it and do better.
3949
I still am confused why this is an issue and someone help me understand this.
3950
If Obama's mother was a US born citizen, how does that not make Obama a US citizen?
3951
And just when I thought Matthews was losing his loud, belligerent, liberal edge.
3952
This is awesome.
3953
It's pretty clear to me that the Republican party tries to appeal to idiots.
3954
That's why they use demagogy all the time.
3955
They are literally trying to win the idiot vote, which is a massive demographic
3956
Priebus and the rest of the GOP aren't used to angry responses.
3957
They think they are the only ones allowed to be angry and condescending.
3958
Even on his show, Matthews has a confrontational style which clearly he didn't leave behind for his Morning Joe appearance.
3959
This priebus character has the most punchable, smirking snide snotty face I have seen on a politician in a long long time.
3960
Slammo!
3961
HA!
3962
As much as Chris Matthews is a hardline ideologue, he's quite good at pushing people to actually explain their positions and their points.
3963
I'd love to see him moderate a debate.
3964
Of course, he's far too left-wing for that to ever happen.
3965
I loved the way Matthews called Priebus out on the right-wing's little-girl giggle fest.
3966
Those disingenuous bone-smokers don't believe their own blarney.
3967
Chris Matthews could have done it a lot better.
3968
He just ranted at the guy in a loud voice reaffirming everything the liberal base wants to hear while only getting one sentence explanations from Priebus.
3969
This wasn't an intellectual debate, it was one-sided, shouting match.
3970
If Chris Matthews had given the guy a chance to talk a little more, he could have really gotten some juicy pieces of derp to make Priebus look like a complete fool.
3971
Like, let Priebus talk a little bit about the 'European Influence' of Obama's economic policies or healthcare, then quip back (in a Chris Matthews style) with something in a calm but confident voice.
3972
The delivery was terrible, and I think it makes liberals look just as bad as the far-right in the "I'M GOING TO TALK OVER YOU" department.
3973
looks like Chris has been watching the newsroom.
3974
rince pribus is a complete tool.
3975
LINK http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlM5VAh-17c
3976
I wish Priebus didn't sputter and continued so that Chris could continue raining destruction on him, instead, the moderators "called it" in an act of mercy.
3977
Wow. Imagine if Chris Matthews had made those same points, while remaining calm and collected.
3978
Imagine if to the other side he didn't appear to signify the whining-screeching liberal stereotype straw-man the GOP has typecasted every left-leaning person to be.
3979
Imagine if this clip were of an eloquent speech to the opposition calmly disabusing them of their privilege to propagate misinformation.
3980
All points were accurate; but this is just another example of the 'liberal media' bashing conservatives--or so the story will continue to go.
3981
I invite anyone to listen to Rush Monday from 11-2 to prove me wrong.
3982
From the comments: "looking to Europe for guidance"?.that's rich when his candidate has Swiss bank accounts.Rancid Penis strikes out again.lol
3983
I'm more worried about why emulating European strategies (if they worked and were good ideas) is considered a negative.
3984
As a student who studies international politics I fail to see what everyone's issue with looking to other countries for guidance are.
3985
There are great governments throughout the world and obviously some countries do things incredibly better than the US does, ie healthcare and education.
3986
Personally, I would openly welcome the thought of combing likes of different systems to our advantage to give our citizens the best possible chance to prosper through education and healthy, worry free (as far as healthcare) lifestyles.
3987
I might be in the minority here but other countries have positive ideas for us to gain additional knowledge and to better existing systems that have more road blocks than smooth sailings.
3988
Ranch Pringles is going to tell republicans to stop going on Morning Joe after this.
3989
It was the last MSNBC show republicans felt they could lie on.
3990
Big Chris Matthews fan over here.
3991
He doesn't LET Republicans dance around the issues he attacks them and makes them answer relatively easy questions that to them are hard because they try to convolute and guide the conversation constantly in a direction that just ends up going in circles instead of just being able to answer the question.
3992
listen to the guy at the end "Garbage, Garbage" What's Garbage?
3993
The fact that he forced you to acknowledge the fact that your party is racist?
3994
Ok Priebus.
3995
Moron.
3996
Chris Matthews has giant wrinkly balls!
3997
Jeez, Chris, you can catch more Republicans with honey than with water.
3998
It's so rare to see real journalism anymore, it's so rare that somebody calls someone on obvious bullshit.
3999
Most news outlets just bow and suck down all this rhetoric and scum.
4000
Good on Chris Matthews.
4001
Chris Matthews was far from courteous in this exchange.
4002
Kinda sounded like a dick.
4003
Not even talking about the issue, but why when Chris Matthews shouts at his guests with different political views do we stand up and cheer, but when O'Reilly does it, we call him a bully?
4004
I'd prefer civil conversation from both sides.
4005
These are the right points, but Chris Matthews needs to work on his delivery.
4006
Have some tact, make the RNC Chair look like the ass.
4007
Unfortunately Matthews comes across as brutish, although correct.
4008
Meanwhile the Democrats can't even follow senate rules and draw up a budget.
4009
For 4 years.
4010
So the Republicans can multi-task?
4011
Chris Matthews has diminished his own brand over the years.
4012
He was stellar in the early days as a sort of young John McLaughlin - Catholic, JFK Democrat that had the moral turpitude to acknowledge that Clinton had disgraced himself by a) sticking cigars in intern pussy and b) allowing this fact to become common knowledge.
4013
After Bush v. Gore, which stoked liberal rage hotter than any time since the Clinton trial, Matthews slowly slid left.
4014
He actually predates Olbermann in terms of the anti-Iraq-war agenda, but allowed Keith to innovate in the field of prime-time slander and Democrat slathering.
4015
The funny thing about Matthews is that he's a Hollywood-B-list-wannabe.
4016
He drools over celebs, especially supermodels.
4017
He has an leering aspect when he's with Katrina van den Heuvel (she likes it).
4018
Chris Matthews is correct.
4019
Though if I was the RNC Chairman, I would have countered with "I suppose we have been pushing the foreigner angle, but hey, it beats blowing the face off a little foreign Afghanistan child while polishing your peace prize.
4020
Your rebuttal Mr. Matthews?"
4021
Chris Mathews is the Sean Hannity of the left.
4022
the whole "Obama is running a negative campaign" thing is a brilliant piece of bull shit.
4023
romney has all this money in PACs and super PACs, so he has them do the negative attacking part and pretend he is not responsible.
4024
Is this the same chrissy matthews that "I get a little cum running down my leg when Barack Hussein Obama speaks"?Have you ever heard Owebama speak when he is not guided by his teleprompter?
4025
"umm, uhh well, you know ummm, uhhh, this lady just fainted, SOMEONE GET A PARALEGAL OVER HERE".
4026
What a stupid Fuck President and Dim Party!
4027
Romney made a stupid joke.
4028
He's on the record multiple times saying he's not a birther.
4029
The grasping at straws here is incredible.
4030
Applauding Chris Matthews for pulling out his typical race card nonsense is just pathetic.
4031
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/born-kenya-obamas-literary-agent-misidentified-birthplace-1991/story?id=16372566#.UDvCk6Bq2uN 'Born in Kenya': Obama's Literary Agent Misidentified His Birthplace in 1991 Here's Obama's full bio from the 1991 brochure: Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.
4032
The son of an American anthropologist and a Kenyan finance minister, he attended Columbia University and worked as a financial journalist and editor for Business International Corporation.
4033
He served as project coordinator in Harlem for the New York Public Interest Research Group, and was Executive Director of the Developing Communities Project in Chicago's South Side.
4034
His commitment to social and racial issues will be evident in his first book, Journeys in Black and White.
4035
Well of course., it's Monday.
4036
That's his Monday position.
4037
It'll change again by Friday.
4038
edit: Please don't downvote this guy.
4039
He's asking a legitimate question that should be answered.
4040
Oh yes, democrats are bringing these issues up.
4041
They are not defending themselves at all.
4042
What I think you mean is that the state sucks at arbitrating justice.
4043
No shit.

"I am shocked at this surprising turn of events."
4048
-Absolutely No Person, Ever
4049
Well, looks like another 'Anti-gay' activist is a gay pedo, seems to be a rather regular occurrence!
4050
Naturally
4051
So, let's add up the shitlist.
4052
Pedophile - Nothing inherently wrong with this condition if you seek help and keep it in check.
4053
He did not.
4054
Betrayer - He was placed in a position of trust with peoples' children, something that is not granted easily and he abused this power to great harm.
4055
This makes it harder for every teacher after him and burdens a taxpayer funded school system with millions of dollars in lawsuits, to say nothing of the harm to his victims.
4056
Rapist - He raped a bunch of children.
4057
I don't think this needs expanding.
4058
Tyrant - Vocally opposing and donating to quash the rights of others while supporting his social grouping's majority rule.
4059
Reprehensible, incredibly short-sighted and deliberately naive.
4060
Traitor - Opposing the rights of a group he belongs to just to keep up social appearances.
4061
Disgusting.
4062
Did I miss anything?
4063
Gay rights and pedophilia are two very different things.
4064
I don't know how comfortable I am with associating the two so closely.
4065
I feel it is exploitative when the someone whit an anti-gay agenda puts child protection out there as an argument, I can not help but feel some of the same here.
4066
EDIT: Maybe I should be more clear.
4067
I never claimed anyone should suppress facts.
4068
It is not uncommon to find anti-gay activists that make NO distinction between homosexuality and pedophilia.
4069
A person from an anti-gay perspective could read this story and say, "Well, there you go, another fag raping boys."
4070
I do not want to give that person the opportunity to do so.
4071
I do not want to unintentionally reinforce someone's prejudice which is what could happen.
4072
I am asking that we collectively agree that his actions are atrocious and predatory, and that homosexuality is not associated with pedophilia.
4073
If there is disagreement then headlines reading "Heterosexual family-man rapes girls."
4074
will be acceptable.
4075
And last time I checked being a family-man or heterosexual has nothing to do with raping girls.
4076
Is it me, or does this guy look just like a chimpanzee?
4077
Ladies and gentlemen, here we see the true dangers of anti-gay legislation and rhetoric.
4078
People like this man, who themselves have homosexual tendencies, are often some of the most outspoken and homophobic participants in the debate.
4079
Having these impulses they have always been taught to spurn and oppress, they come to believe that everyone has the same urges and that everyone must work just as hard to repress them.
4080
Hence, they outwardly condem homosexuality just like they internalize the criticism of it they have been subject to their whole lives.
4081
Hence, they seek an outlet for their sexual frustrations and, more often than not, such an outlet is an individual with some level of reduced agency, such as a child.
4082
They believe that assaulting a child is easier to hush up than having a competent homosexual relationship.
4083
This phenomenon happens with plenty of criticized sexual practices (including priests who are regulated to a life of celibacy).
4084
A lot of anti-gay individuals like to claim that homosexuals are equal to pedophiles which is roughly the equivalent of saying that "I'm responsible for removing any form of outlet for these individuals and will place said responsibility on their shoulders at the inevitable point in which they fuck up."
4085
Legalizing same-sex marriage is just a step.
4086
We need to stop raising children who are ashamed of who they are.
4087
dat repression
4088
www.gayhomophobe.com
4089
shows the number of days since the last anti-gay politician was outed.
4090
I look forward to this list being updated.
4091
Only sexually and morally depraved individuals can be so militantly anti-gay.
4092
It's not their business.
4093
He was also my first grade teacher.
4094
Is anyone surprised that the anti-gay activist was diddling young boys?
4095
No? No one?
4096
This shouldn't even be surprising anymore, it happens all the time.
4097
It's called reaction formation, a well documented Freudian defense mechanism where you exhibit unacceptable behavior, and react by actively condemning said behavior.
4098
Similarly, the founder of Boy Scouts of America, a outrightly anti-gay organization, is rumored to have been gay.
4099
(Think about it, he never married, which, in his day, is a pretty good indicator.
4100
Instead, he hung around young boys all day)
4101
Doesn't make him gay, makes him a sick pedophile who needs to go away.
4102
Honestly, I'd be surprised to find an anti-gay nutbag who doesn't have some really dark personal issues.
4103
Their entire argument is based on the idea that sexual morality is about meaningless rules rather than consent and not causing harm.
4104
If people argue that a consensual, loving relationship is morally equivalent with raping children, as these people routinely do, if we take them at their word when they make those claims we have to acknowledge that they are all admitting the only thing keeping them from raping defenseless children is a fucking book of fairytales.
4105
As it turns out, the anti-gay guy was just running from something inside of him.
4106
This is nothing new.
4107
The strange thing is society's reaction to it, especially from the opponents.
4108
It's like "HAHA, GOTCHA!".
4109
We don't think of him as gay himself, but that's absolutely what is going on here.
4110
What if some prominent white supremacist blogger turned out to be black?
4111
When the news broke, would you say "HAHAHA, GOTCHA!
4112
God damn white supremacist was black all along!"
4113
No, you would see that this man's political opinions were a deep seated psychological issue.
4114
The anti-gay activist in question is simply a self hating gay guy.
4115
You don't want to consider him gay, because that puts him on the team that you are defending, but that's what he is.
4116
How can you defend him while attacking him?
4117
Of course, there will be those that claim he is not in fact a homosexual; that he simply has sex with boys.
4118
Don't be silly.
4119
He is both a homosexual and a pedophile.
4120
People will want to remove the gay label from him because that would make it more ethically ambiguous to attack him.
4121
The man is gay.
4122
The man is a pedophile.
4123
You may only attack the pedophile side of him, but you may not attack him for hypocrisy.
4124
To do that would make it hypocrisy to be a self hater, and that's not what it is.
4125
It's closer to insanity than it is to hypocrisy.
4126
Whenever I meet or hear about a homophobe I just assume that they are gay.
4127
well blow me.wait, no!
4128
Repressed gays are non-repressed gays' worst enemies .
4129
This happens so often, considering the unknown cases, how many non-gay anti-gay activists are there?
4130
It's because of fagots like him that honest, caring and HOMOSEXUAL men (like me) face ridiculous obstacles when they want to teach children.
4131
And once again we find evidence that pedophiles hate gay people.
4132
Liberals should start pulling a fox news and claim that all anti-gay leaders are secretly pedophiles.
4133
The irony!
4134
Well time to update GayHomophobe.com.
4135
IMHO: These people fight gay rights so much because since they have to fight the urge, they honestly believe everyone has to constantly fight the urge to be gay.
4136
Not really surprising.
4137
People with secret closeted tendencies tend to be outspoken against those tendencies.
4138
They're not trying to convince you they're trying to convince themselves.
4139
"Here’s hoping that all straight folks everywhere one day realize that antigay ravers come in just two flavours: assholes who are externalizing their own internal struggles against homosexual desires (Ted Haggard, Larry Craig, Charlie Crist, Joseph Ratzinger, et al.) and assholes who are attempting to compensate for and/or draw attention away from their own moral shortcomings (David Vitter, Mark Sanford, John Ensign, Vic Toews, et al.)."
4140
~Dan Savage
4141
It's nice how no one who is against Prop 8 or is a gay activist has ever been charged with a sex crime.
4142
I love irony so much.
4143
Who wants to bet he is a republican too?
4144
YA DON'T SAY!
4145
I like the part where this was posted by an LGBT activism site.
4146
To the people below: Pedophile =/= gay.
4147
If someone makes false allegations, such as gays being equatable to pedophiles, I think the default assumption should be that accuser is guilty of the same crimes.
4148
Why did they stop making to catch a predator.
4149
I'd love to see Chris Hansen run in to these guys
4150
that's the second one this week: http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/08/24/anti-gay-activist-louisiana-pastor-convicted-for-masturbating-in-public-video/
4151
When are people going to learn that extremest who try to oppress people are normally doing it to cover up the skeletons in their closets.
4152
It can't be described in a soundbite so.yes.
4153
The state houses are working on it.
4154
How could people have forgotten about it if they were never actually educated on it in the first place?
4155
Nothing happend, carry on, all is well, nobody is ripping you off, keep spending!
4156
Amazing how there was hardly any coverage at all in the US.
4157
It's such a big red flag!
4158
I was told there would be no math?
4159
Honestly what can we do?
4160
The way I understand it is that we cant even really punish these people for their actions.
4161
Twist: The people who are in charge of those who would make a report about the LIBOR scandal are the ones who are part of the LIBOR scandal!
4162
Oh wait.
4163
The problem is that it's too big and complicated for the average american to contemplate, let alone get enraged about.
4164
We live an ELI5 world, and this is something you have to be at least 10 to understand.
4165
This is why Republicans are so good at what they do.
4166
They can boil their message down to 'us good, them bad'.
4167
That's why you have so many idiots advocating a return to the gold standard.
4168
They can't comprehend the positive effects of inflation on a currency.
4169
All they know is 'gold good, inflation bad'.
4170
For the time being, yes, but stay tuned
4171
The sad thing is, there isn't much we can do about it.
4172
The system was set up so banks would have a hard time colluding to "rig" it, since the outliers would be discarded any single bank trying to game the system would fail to do so.
4173
The problem is, almost every single bank tried to game the system (and in the same way, which is odd for some pretty arcane reasons).
4174
Let's also keep in mind that Barclays bank has been effectively owned by the uk government since they accepted bailout money back in '08.
4175
In fact the bank was getting calls from politicians wanting them to do exactly what they and all the other banks involved did.
4176
Manipulate the libor rate to much lower levels so that it would look like things wernt really as bad as they were.
4177
The politicians could then claim that they had solved the problems and therefore were worthy of re-election.
4178
The banks are still guilty for doing it but all I see are bankers heads rolling.
4179
None of the politicians who probably demanded more than begged to make this happen
4180
In short, Yes.
4181
Caring about the foundation of financial word and bedrock of banking has taken a back seat to red versus blue.
4182
Bread and circus for all, or food stamps and reality T.V.
4183
Probably because Jon Stewart & Stephen Colbert are on vacation
4184
In bitcoin we trust
4185
There was just no real scandal to begin with.
4186
This has been explained over and over again by financial blogs and even Matt Taibbi but it simply hasn't gotten any tread in popular media because it isn't really that easy to explain.
4187
But I'm going to give it a shot. 1) Everyone in the finance industry has had four years to get really cozy with the fact that governments, central banks and The Banks are in collusion to drop interest rates through the floor, keep them there and screw any net saver on the planet for as long as GDP growth remains illusive so that banks won't have an asset firesale and throw us into a pit of deflationary hell.
4188
This included banks being encouraged to give LIBOR submissions at rates much lower than they could have actually borrowed at during such times that their solvency was being questioned on a nightly basis.
4189
2) No one ever cared about a bunch of traders attempting to manipulate interest rates by colluding together because this is what traders do and, more importantly, there were probably about the same number of traders trying to do the exact same thing on the other side of it.
4190
It isn't as if this is something that just appeared out of thin air .
4191
people have been saying this for more than a decade or longer.
4192
Moreover, this issue is far too opaque for anyone to have any real idea of what was done or how much who owes who.
4193
So, anyone who works in finance that doesn't have some legal case up their sleeve gives no shits.
4194
Retail, that's you guys, also shouldn't care because a few 1/100ths of a percent on your 30 year mortgage doesn't amount to anything especially when it can't be reliably said which way they were manipulating rates on a given day.
4195
3) What isn't too opaque is figuring out how much banks/central banks/governments would owe the collective investing populace if everyone decided at the same time that they could be held liable for manipulating interest rates several hundred times lower for much longer periods than any group of traders could have dreamed, the entire world would go into bankruptcy wars of attrition alla WWII fairly quickly.
4196
In fact, that's the reason they decided to manipulate the rates in the first place!
4197
So in summary, what traders did in small amounts isn't really discernible and is dwarfed several hundred times by what central banks/governments do every single day, so fuck it.
4198
And, what central banks/governments are guilty of doing to prop up zombie banks seems better than the alternative which is almost certainly worse than what we are experiencing now.
4199
Two words - news cycle.
4200
Of course people still care - Barclay's reputation has taken a real hit, and let's remember that this was the biggest fine ever handed out by a UK financial regulator.
4201
However, the newspapers have moved on.
4202
It's just not an "interesting" enough issue to dwell on for longer than a week.
4203
I find it interesting that many of the American Redditors are complaining that the details were never reported.
4204
It seems to depend where you get your news from.
4205
I read The Guardian in the UK, and I was exposed to several lengthy articles explaining the scandal in depth.
4206
I don't doubt that if I read the Sun (a trashy UK tabloid) I would not be familiar with the details.
4207
Likewise, most "news" websites focus on simple, easy-to-digest news stories.
4208
If you complain that you aren't given the full details of this kind of story, it might be wise to start getting your news elsewhere.
4209
I can't vouch for this, but I suspect that the Wall Street Journal dwelled on this story for some time.
4210
I just did a google news search, almost 3,000 articles related to "LIBOR" in the last 24 hours.
4211
So when you say "everybody" you mean something else, don't you?
4212
edit: I searched again for "libor scandal" and got 267 results.
4213
I bring this up to people almost every day.
4214
Nearly every person I talk to has no idea what I'm talking about.
4215
The media plays what they want you to see.
4216
We were too busy following the Colorado shooting and Chik Fil A loving gay bashers and the Olympics when the story broke to care.
4217
well Snooki had a baby and there's dorito tacos
4218
Remember Kony.? LOL
4219
LIBOR went the way of the EuroZone/Greece crisis.
4220
Because a) people have 5 second attention spans and b) there's so much crazy shit going on it's hard to keep track of what to be mad about.
4221
I was kind of hoping some patriot would start assassinating high profile bankers.
4222
No, but if the authorities aren't going to do anything about it, what are you going to do?
4223
It is the same with every other scandal.
4224
Until you get millions of people out in the streets, nothing will happen.
4225
Good luck getting millions of Americans out in the streets.
4226
I didn't!
4227
I named my new cat LIBOR so I can never forget!
4228
KONY 2012
4229
OIS is going to replace it.
4230
http://wealthcycles.com/blog/2012/07/20/market-based-libor-replacement-is-step-in-right-direction
4231
Personally I think the Chik-fil-a thing was made up just to silence the media on the LIBOR scandal.
4232
Have Chik-fil-a take up all the "news space" so LIBOR wouldn't get any attention.
4233
This story will never be allowed to gain traction in the MSM with good reason, it can't be soundbite into something for a 15s blurb and it is actual news.
4234
It is not entertaining to for news to tell you your being robbed of your future.
4235
It will not be shown in enough detail to allow people to think.
4236
I think basically sums it up (albeit, it relates to mass murderers, but I think the principle behind it is generally the same): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFtkJd8w5UQ
4237
Did everyone just stop caring about the U.S. soldier(s) who tore through an Afghan village executing men, women, and children a few months ago?
4238
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/9137035/US-soldier-kills-16-Afghans-in-shooting-rampage.html
4239
In /r/politics we will only care about the LIBOR policy if in doing so we can accomplish the following: Discuss how all republicans hate all black people Call republicans "Nazis" Somehow throw in some comments about Fox News (Just add comments about Fox News for instant upvotes).
4240
But in all seriousness, why would we care about real issues here?
4241
Why not focus on things like Rape, Republicans going to strip clubs, or Romney's tax returns?
4242
us Americans don't like numbers and stuffs.
4243
It requires someone to read/know about 250 words of information.
4244
Unless you can get that down to 250 charachters, people won't care.
4245
No one expects anything to be done.
4246
Who was held accountable for the last financial meltdown?
4247
It's due to lack of coverage, not people "not getting it."
4248
All you have to tell someone is that their mortgage/credit card bill is higher than it otherwise would be because rich folks are rigging the system and I assure you people would be pissed.
4249
If there's any other reason that people didn't pay too much attention to this it's because they already assumed that the banks were ripping them off and the specifics didn't interest them.
4250
Who is Robert Holmes?
4251
For me its jsut the fact that this happens so often now, that I have come to expect it.
4252
The corporate media is burying the story.
4253
Interesting how they are so powerful they can create the general impression that 'nobody' cares.
4254
One of the biggest frauds in the history of capitalism but it doesn't attract viewers so they don't talk about it much on the news.
4255
Hard to make a well informed vote whent the news media is so blatantly $ driven.
4256
Paid advertisements in a news broadcast is a joke.
4257
The what?
4258
My belief is that a few very smart people looked into it in depth and couldn't find a straightforward answer to the question "Who got hurt and how much did they lose?".
4259
Without victims, it's hard to keep a story active.
4260
The public has a very short memory for EVERYTHING.
4261
How is it surprising that Libor is any different?
4262
Yes, because nothing is going to happen.
4263
The rich and powerful are too entrenched.
4264
The media stopped covering it.
4265
Better yet, in America, we never even started caring about it!
4266
I just never cared.
4267
Plus this is reddit so yes.
4268
Did people just stop caring about kony?
4269
Including Obama?
4270
o.0
4271
Regardless of peoples attempts to make it a US only issue its going to take a while.
4272
This only came to light what, last month?
4273
They have a lot of pieces of paperwork to find.
4274
Qui bono?Who benefits?
4275
Who benefits from the lack of reporting on the LIBOR Scandal?
4276
Answer that and you have your answer.
4277
But Mitt Romney's dog was riding ontop of his tax returns in the cayman islands while his jobs where shipping over seas.bain
4278
capital
4279
"Stop caring" implies that there was a point in time when people did care about it.
4280
Americans don't give a shit about enormous financial crimes and corruption when there's piddly culture war bullshit we could be obsessing over instead.
4281
i don't think anyone cared to begin with.
4282
Because if there's no new news on it, there's not a lot to discuss other than unfounded speculation?
4283
These inflammatory titles don't solve anything.
4284
I don't think that people ever really understood it well enough in the first place.
4285
It isn't as easy to wrap your mind around as a scandal involving meth and prostitutes.
4286
Everyone was "news cycled" out of being interested in on of the biggest financial scandals in modern history.
4287
Kind of like the housing bubble thingy.
4288
Why should we care about LIBOR scandal, when gays are getting married and abortions are happening?
4289
Seriously dude, PRIORITIES.
4290
Who's Trayvon Martin?
4291
I think the number of comments this post received is also an indicator of how few redditors actually care about it.
4292
If I had time I would look up posts on LIBOR when the news was first released, and look at the number of comments for comparison.
4293
What does this have to do with Snooki's baby or Stretch Armstrong?
4294
It is just getting so hard to care about anything like this any more.
4295
Everyday there is a new scandal to get angry about we are spread too thin.
4296
When Paul Ryan was made Romney's running mate?
4297
I can't remember that far back.
4298
Perfect example of why we are in trouble as a nation.
4299
The so called national news is strictly a propaganda machine for the corporate conservatives.
4300
Fox for the hate filled conservatives.
4301
There will be no coverage of LIBOR, No mention of Romney's tax returns etc .
4302
You can't do anything other than forget it--it is basically proof to the entire world that the market is rigged--the global financial market is rigged and everyone already knows that.
4303
We pretend we don't know it because we hope that at some point we may make it to the table to play and then it will be our turn, but in fact it will never be our turn, and until someone devises a way to do away with the current system it is the best we have.
4304
We need to create a better system from the ground up and displace the current system we have, but that is going to take decades of hard work and some revolution.
4305
The powers that be told everyone to shut the fuck up.
4306
We have moved on to gay chickens.
4307
In a word: yes
4308
I decided never to start.
4309
The problem with LIBOR is that it's nothing new.
4310
Oh, big finance is completely corrupt?
4311
Tell me something I don't know.
4312
RAPE! ABORTION!
4313
LOOK-BABY-KILLERS!
4314
I'm not Matt Taibi.
4315
Being really pissed off about this doesn't pay for my condo.
4316
Nor will my caring about this issue change the face of international banking.
4317
No, just the media and their allies, the politicians.
4318
the media decided it wasn't worth covering so the case was dismissed in the court of public opinion.
4319
ppl dont care about fed/ecb manipulation, libor is nothing versus that
4320
The problem with the crimes of international bankers and wall street, is that the language is just legal mumbo jumbo to most people, and it's hard to follow.
4321
We're a sound-bite society, so don't be surprised when complicated issues are ignored.
4322
Most people have a very short attention OH LOOK A SQUIRREL IN THE TREE OUTSIDE!
4323
Because most people realized they benefited from it (student loans, mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc.)
4324
Here's the thing.
4325
In the States, if we were allowed to understand the breadth and depth of this LIBOR shit we might actually be roused enough to take up arms against the sons of bitches running the world of big finance who caused the massive shit storm we're currently digging ourselves out of.
4326
Oh, wow, another country's courts went after the bankers who fucked them without consent in the ass?
4327
HEY WHAT A NOVEL IDEA!
4328
But, no.
4329
We have to keep the status quo.
4330
That means we bail out the banks and let them continue to go about business as usual so that 25 years from now we can see another total fucking meltdown.
4331
Next time, let's call it the.
4332
Futures Bubble!
4333
Where we realize that theorizing on the potential cost of a raw product 20 years outside of its production could be a bad thing and ultimately jack prices way the fuck up because investors on a large scale who have the most to lose will not allow those investments to go foul.
4334
So let's pay $15.00 for a gallon of gasoline because these assholes thought that's how much it should be worth 15 years ago.
4335
I'm not bitter.
4336
Seems like the conversation dwindled.
4337
Another in a long, unfinished, list of scandals and rip offs.
4338
The infographic on here a while back did a good job explaining it.
4339
Wiki isn't too bad either.
4340
chicken scandal trumped it.
4341
The real scandal has not occurred yet because the lawsuits are just starting to trickle in.
4342
Once these banks have to write off ridiculous amounts of cash from their balance sheets, their stock prices will be affected and once that happens the news will be spending 24/7 on this story.
4343
It was replaced with rape and women's vagina's.again.
4344
For that to happen they would have needed to care in the first place.
4345
It takes a little time to prepare law suits.
4346
Is it legitimate?
4347
Republicans can't figure out a way to blame it on Obama.
4348
When it couldn't be connected to Mittens or the Republican Party, politics collectively lost interest.
4349
There are scarier things happening . . .
4350
Snooki's child was born.
4351
Setting the interest rates is business as usual for the FED, so nothing to see here.
4352
Yup we care about stupid comments made about rape now.
4353
sigh.
4354
You must be new to America, let me explain.
4355
Every so often a devious and controversial scandal will pop up among out leaders of government.
4356
It's the duty of the American media to mention as little as possible about it, but preferably nothing at all.
4357
Then, when the internet savy discover said controversial scandal, they let everyone they can know about it and while many online would agree that whatever it is, is wrong, they will forget it in a few days to continue pretending the system isn't broken, and that the only way to get change is by voting, since they know voter fraud is illegal and by-golly American politicians would just never do such a thing like that.
4358
I'm saving up my anger for the next horrible thing major businesses get caught doing.
4359
Kony 2012
4360
No, that's how much money they're spending to keep it as quiet as possible
4361
There is a really great diagram that is KISS over on dailyclout.
4362
The site is currently down, sigh.
4363
You think that's bad, nobody even started to care about trapwire.
4364
I never stopped caring- I was just paid not to say anything.
4365
i'm sure there's a riveting reality show on somewhere
4366
If I gave a minute a day to every scandal, cheat, liar, horrible tragedy, not so horrible tragedy, or corporate fucking the world is given by their wealthy masters I'd never have a moment to myself.
4367
Or to sleep.
4368
You can sum it up: "Class war is real, and you peasants are losing it."
4369
Rage on that for about ten minutes and call it good.
4370
That covers most of it.
4371
Yes
4372
Thats like asking if we've forgotten about the RCA or Teapot Dome Scandal.
4373
Same as it ever was.
4374
Yup
4375
If and when some town sues and wins a humongous award, then people will understand and get interested.
4376
FI isn't as glamorous as equities.
4377
Welcome to the internet, you must be new.
4378
Do you need a guide?
4379
The past issue of the economist had nothing but.
4380
It doesn't sound like anyone, particularly the lawyers, will stop caring for a long time.
4381
I think there's far more to come, however.
4382
LIBOR is small potatoes.
4383
Yes, what do I care, in any case i have no money in the bank.
4384
No, the media stopped caring and society has lost its resolve.
4385
This is the kind of thing that happens just before societies collapse (or not?).
4386
Honestly, I think it's wanker-banker shenanigans fatigue.
4387
We've been beaten down by the endless flow of douchebaggery.
4388
I still don't understand it.
4389
All I get is that a bunch of bankers fucked with the standard interest rate and were gaming the system in a lot of big banks, how it was really endemic, and how absolutely no one will ever be punished ever for it.
4390
Yes. Caring is hard.
4391
Similarly, I could say So did everyone just stop caring about TrapWire?
4392
The LIBOR scandal is too abstract for the average person.
4393
Right now most who have heard about it only think of it as some shady general shenanigans that we all assume happens already amongst all the big banks and such.
4394
When it can be directly tied to a/the financial collapse or a million people losing their house/jobs or some super corrupt named politicians it will become a prime news story.
4395
Basically a scandal needs definite victims and scapegoat of some sort.
4396
Given the nice big picture of that bikini-clad lady, this post might be considered NSFW.
4397
If she doesn't want to vote, nobody's stopping her.
4398
Remember, the rich and the corporations create jobs and keep the economy going.
4399
They have nothing to spare, so we much give them tax breaks as well as keep the fines minimal to ensure a strong economy.
4400
I keep telling out of state people, California still has plenty of quite powerful conservatives/Republicans.
4401
Good thing they weren't making pesto pizzas that day.
4402
I always, ALWAYS read the comments on an article before reading the actual article.
4403
It's like a primer.
4404
FYI, the student was sued for uploading songs.
4405
AFAIK nobody has ever been sued for illegally downloading songs.
4406
It was a jury that decided on the $675,000 penalty.
4407
As with drug laws, people are only too happy to fashion their own chains.
4408
Apparently about 122 redditors (give or take based on the fuzzing mechanism on reddit) at the time of this post don't understand the difference between regulatory actions undertaken by the executive (OSHA) and damages determined by a lawsuit in our judiciary.
4409
Hint: An OSHA finding doesn't mean the worker can't sue the pizza maker.
4410
Pizza manufacturing?
4411
OSHA fines are very rare You don't work in the energy industry I see.
4412
What did the pizza company do to cause the employee to cut off his finger?
4413
What the fuck OP.
4414
This has been discussed many many times before.
4415
Joel Tenenbaum had the chance to settle.
4416
He had multiple warnings from multiple sources to stop uploading those songs.
4417
Whoever upvotes this shit is just confirming r/politics is a r/circlejerk.
4418
People are never going to take anything you say seriously if shit like this keeps getting upvoted.
4419
When I come back this thread better be in the negative downvotes or I'm leaving r/politics and starting my own subreddit with blackjack and hookers.
4420
Two entirely different things.
4421
One involves negligence in the work place or improper use of machinery.
4422
The other involves knowingly engaging in illegal activity.
4423
This question should be posted in /r/wtf.
4424
Because I really had to ask myself what the fuck kind of rationality is behind this statement.
4425
You are making an insanely dissimilar analogy between the two cases.
4426
More /r/politics falsehoods spun to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
4427
The student didn't download 31 songs, he uploaded them.
4428
He seeded them to thousands of people, ignored multiple cease & desist orders, and was even seeding them during the trial.
4429
This isn't even comparing apples to oranges, this is comparing apples to clouds or rocks or something.
4430
The two cases aren't even remotely similar and should not be compared.
4431
Unfortunately, you are wrong.
4432
OSHA fines are not rare and the fines are not laughable.
4433
I own a manufacturing company.
4434
I have never received a fine because we are ultra-careful when it comes to safety, but many other companies I know of have received fines in excess of $50,000.00 for missing guards on machines (no injury involved) or $10,000.00 for employees not wearing seat belts while running forklifts (also no injury involved).
4435
While the fine you list may be laughable, there is no proof that the subject employee was injured because of workplace hazards.
4436
it may have been carelessness.
4437
The fine may be the result of other findings after an inspection due to the injury.
4438
I don't know, and neither do you.
4439
As far as the kid getting fined for downloading, he knowingly broke the law.
4440
Is the fine reasonable?
4441
Hell no.
4442
Are they trying to make an example of him?
4443
Yes, absolutely.
4444
While Palermo's Pizza is a great example of a terrible company that mistreats it's employees (Google them), this isn't a reasonable comparison.
4445
I could compare Weldon Angelos (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeldonAngeloscase)
4446
getting busted for $350 worth of pot getting 55 years in prison to Casey Anthony murdering her daughter and walking scott-free and say that America's priorities are totally fucked.
4447
The comparison is staggering, but it doesn't mean a damn thing because I'm just looking for extreme instances and these two cases (which have nothing to do with one another) don't really highlight anything of substance.
4448
All you are really saying is, "Wow, look at this tiny penalty a company got for being negligent, while this college kid got hammered with a massive fine for illegal downloading."
4449
They have nothing to do with one another and are the most extreme examples of each situation available.
4450
Also, Palermos is nowhere near the "one of the largest private label pizza manufacturers" in America.
4451
As their own website says (at the bottom http://www.palermospizza.com/history.aspx)
4452
they are one of the "Top 75 privately held businesses in the state of Wisconsin."
4453
1) There is a massive difference in a jury award for an action against a company and a fine for violating safety regulations (it also doesn't cover the settlement the worker will most likely get).
4454
2) People need to hammer into their head the difference in "downloading" and "distributing" music.
4455
Very very few people have ever been sued for simply downloading a song.
4456
What people get busted for is making the song downloadable to anyone from their own computer via their own internet connection.
4457
If you don't want to get in trouble then leech and stop seeding files or making them open from your computer.
4458
An OSHA fine of only $2000 most likely means the company did all they could to reasonably protect the worker, but the worker was able to intentionally violate procedures (such as removing a guard) and hurt himself.Also, the $675k was not for downloading, but for sharing, and likely could've been significantly reduced if the adult grad student and his lawyer weren't douchebags throughout the whole process.
4459
Your analogy is terrible.
4460
Those two things are completely unrelated.
4461
WITH EVERY NOTE YOU DOWNLOAD, YOU CUT OFF A MUSICIAN'S FINGER!
4462
He wasn't fined for downloading the songs.
4463
How does anyone out there not already know this?
4464
Actually.
4465
In regards to the pizza company, was the issue fault of the pizza place, was the operator negligent, or some combination?
4466
That is important to know.
4467
Additionally, were they knowingly breaking laws?
4468
In regards to the person taking songs, they knowingly broke an established law and they got slapped very hard for it.
4469
I don't think the amount they had to pay was fair at all; however, it's kind of hard to compare these two examples 'apples to apples'.
4470
When are you people going to get over this?
4471
He could have settled for $3k at the first warning - he pushed it to the end and he lost.
4472
Now he has to pay for wasting all those lawyers' time not to mention to number of potential lost sales of hit songs over an eight year period.
4473
Yes - his actions almost certainly caused some loss of sales.
4474
Grow the fuck up already.
4475
The knee-jerk is swift on this one.
4476
Where's the false equivalence crew?
4477
Of all the thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of real life examples of power imbalance between corporations and workers, you find one that makes no sense.
4478
Congratulations.
4479
Go into a music store.
4480
Steal 5 CDs with double the amount of songs.
4481
See what your fine is.
4482
There's no way it would be even a fraction of this guy's.
4483
Dissimilarity between the two cases aside, the punishment should fit the crime and I think $675k for the sharing of 31 songs is disproportionate to the offense.
4484
True, the kid was stupid for not settling and, as the article stated, he refused at length to accept responsibility, but that, IMHO, shouldn't be life-ruining.pound of flesh on the part of the RIAA, I guess.
4485
The real comparison is how unfair things are is the fact that corporations can steal millions from workers in wage theft and get a civil lawsuit at worse, while if you embezzle a few thousand from your company jail time is pretty certain.
4486
Am I the only one that thinks downloading media should be free and legal?
4487
So long as people don't profit from it, I really don't see the harm in it.
4488
These two instances don't equate at all.
4489
One is a legal ruling from civil court (in this case, where the RIAA sued a file-sharer), while the other is a governmental agency levying a fine against a corporation, and there is no saying that if malpractice caused the injury that the person can't sue their employer.
4490
But of course it has all the good keywords for /r/politics: power imbalance, corporation, average American.
4491
All the right words to get an uninformed moron's jimmies rustled.
4492
Add in Chick-fil-a, Mitt Romney, and conservative and you'll make /r/politics explode.
4493
I had no idea that OSHA fined someone $675,000 for downloading songs.
4494
See the problem when you compare two completely different things?
4495
OSHA fines are very rare, and when they do occur the amount companies are fined is laughable at best.
4496
This is not true at all.
4497
OSHA can come in and shut down companies.
4498
Many of the regulations they have are insane, and the inspectors don't look to fix problems, they attempt to get you to break them so they can fine you, which they earn a commission off of.
4499
Example of a stupid rule, which has earned our company an OSHA fine (one of many): many workers at the plant come from Mexico (in Texas, low paying manufacturing jobs).
4500
There, they are used to throwing toilet paper in the trash because piping is bad there.
4501
But here, we flush everything.
4502
However, they throw the toilet paper on the floor by the toilet after wiping their ass, leaving shit streaks on the floor.
4503
A janitor comes and cleans it up (the natural solution) with a mop.
4504
But, that is a violation of an OSHA code.
4505
To clean up that shit mark, you need to treat it as a biohazard and come in with hazmat suits.
4506
So, we got fined for it.
4507
Also, they look at paperwork more than actually looking at the plant.
4508
Buddy of mine was moving his small business (comp repair) and currently had all his paperwork in his garage at home while he was in the process of moving into a shop a mile away.
4509
OSHA or another government body shows up, asks for the paperwork.
4510
He says it's at home and he can run and grab it and be back in 10 minutes.
4511
They say no, you can't do that, and he is fined several thousand dollars.
4512
OSHA and other government fines aren't rare.
4513
And it's not always the fine that hits you.
4514
It's the, "You need to replace these machines that are hundreds of thousands of dollars each because they aren't up to new standards."
4515
And they can shut you down if they want to.
4516
Stop production for a few days or weeks.
4517
We output millions of pounds of meat per day.
4518
It's not just the fines that matter.
4519
In addition to OSHA, we get audited by several other companies that we supply meat to so we can fit their standards as well.
4520
TL;DR: OSHA can rape you harder than you could believe, and can do more than just fine you.
4521
All from behind some paperwork without examining the actual situation.
4522
For those that hate me for this: Yes OSHA needs to be there.
4523
It is there to protect workers.
4524
It just needs to be more efficient and run to enforce the rules, not rape you for commission.
4525
Inspectors need to do a better job.
4526
Can go on and on about this.Probably already said too much, but I regret nothing.
4527
This is an awful analogy.
4528
The student wasn't "fined" $675,000.
4529
He isn't paying that to the state or the fed.
4530
He's paying that to the plaintiff in the case.
4531
The OSHA fine is just that, a fine.
4532
If the employee can prove in a court of law, that the company was negligent or responsible for him/her losing his/her fingers, that person can and will sue the company and the company will owe them considerably more than $675,000.00 .
4533
The student was sued, and ordered to pay damages, for uploading/sharing copyrighted songs, not downloading them.
4534
It, therefore, is a matter of him cheating record companies and artists out of untold thousands of sales.
4535
Sounds fair to me.
4536
These two issues aren't even comparable.
4537
The OSHA fine was levied by OSHA.not by a court.
4538
The person who lost their fingers can and probably will sue the employer and win much more than $675k in damages (the case will likely settle out of court).
4539
The "fine" for "sharing" 31 songs isn't a fine at allIt is damages that have been awarded by a court after a plaintiff successfully proved that they suffered said damages as a result of this person sharing those 31 songs with untold thousands of people who might otherwise have purchased the songs.
4540
Big, huge, gigantic, ENORMOUS difference.
4541
If the file sharer's lawyer has half an ounce of sense, he'll run to file a bankruptcy first thing in the morning.
4542
TIL that 1 song is worth at least 22 human fingers.
4543
But please check my work: at least 2 fingers / $2000 * $675000 / 31 songs = 21.77
4544
fingers/song (rounding up because a 23% finger stub has no knuckles left) Is that technically a nub, or a nubbin?
4545
Someone please help me out here.
4546
Edit: Of course the comparison is absurd, except if you are the Taliban.
4547
This is not an apples to apples comparison, your argument is suspect.
4548
Hmmm.so, regulations and lobbying disproportionately work against individuals vs. corporations.
4549
Huh, who woulda thunk it!
4550
/sarc
4551
While I agree that it is ridiculous and it should not be a criminal offense at all, comparing an accident to somebody who willingly broke the law doesn't really hold much water.
4552
Absolutely right.
4553
That's just one example of both how much the balance of power has shifted away from workers and/or labor and to the big business interests.
4554
One of my other favorite examples was how, after BP had exploded a deluge of oil all over the Gulf of Mexico, they somehow managed to lean on a variety of local gov't agencies to block off sections of the beach to prevent even just reporting of the disaster.
4555
Bottom line is that if you're representing a business in our society, you have almost unlimited power.
4556
But as a consumer/worker/individual, we're all at a very low historical ebb.
4557
There has always been a class war going on and as Warren Buffett himself says, his side has "won".
4558
While this is comparing apples and oranges I do think we have every right to be utterly outraged at the insane leverage corporations and government have over people right now.
4559
In the UK people are being arrested for insulting people over Twitter, rioters are thrown in jail for 10 years for stealing shoes, the LIBOR scandal will/has affected countless millions yet no banker has been made accountable etc etc. Meanwhile some poor bastard is being fined $675k for downloading some music?
4560
There is absolutely no fucking justice in the world and we should all be outraged.
4561
I certainly am.
4562
I'm sorry but this post is fucking retarded, you cant even compare those 2 things.
4563
I'm the piracy guy uploaded songs illegally which is committing a crime, the corporation had a WORKER who accidentally got hes fingers cut off.
4564
Even though I think the pizza guy should get more money and the student should get less of a fine, you still cant compare it.
4565
Stop with this mindless CORPORATIONS ARE BAD! hivemind, you're fucking pathetic.
4566
An accident versus a person breaking a law.
4567
Yes easily compared.
4568
I was just reading an article in the ABA, and the U.S. certainly doesn't have the best legal system in the world although it is good.
4569
This kind of nonsense points out some problems, although the pizza manufacturer story could have some details we don't know about.
4570
He should just give them the finger!
4571
So that's what that crunchy thing on my pizza was
4572
The music example alone makes the whole point as well as it could be made
4573
That's all nice but what are people going to do about it.The answer so far is absolutely nothing.
4574
How does one go about manufacturing a pizza, exactly?
4575
Three-fingered Hobb makes the best pizzas in all of Westeros
4576
Not defending the $675k, but the pizza worker will probably get a big workers comp insurance payment, regardless of who or what caused his accident.
4577
Another sensationalized title that displays the OP's complete lack of understanding of the issue.
4578
I must be in r/politics.
4579
The fact is that most companies just ignore fines from OSHA.
4580
They usually just post them on a board and eventually pay off the fines, it's far cheaper than making any requested renovations that would cost more money, and provide more safety.
4581
Why do I feel the class warfare is really close?
4582
Excuse my ignorance, but how does an average person go about paying off $675,000?
4583
Will he essentially be in debt almost his entire life?
4584
i think insurance takes care of his finger n the company has workers comp, music industry can potentially lose hundreds of thousands if not millions from 31 songs being put up for free and there's no insurance for that plus a big difference between an accident and blatantly committing and illegal action
4585
False analogy.
4586
I'm not going to argue the premise, but your choice of comparison is a poor one.
4587
There is clearly a difference based on negligence versus intent.
4588
Mmm italian sausage fingers
4589
Anyone think it'd be cool to raise enough money for that kid to pay off the 675k?
4590
It'd be a nice bitchslap to whomever thought it was a good idea to "send a message".
4591
i torrent out of protest, tbh.
4592
ive thought out buying a chromebook, a nexus and moving all my shit over to google (i had it all in my cart on amazon, card number typed in) and using the google play store or amazon to view content.
4593
ive got a prime and hulu plus account.but in the end, half the shit i wanted to watch, i couldn't find on there or anywhere else.
4594
i want simpsons.
4595
i want movies that are $5 at best buy to not cost $10 on google play.
4596
i dont want to have to rebuy shit i already bought this year.
4597
i dont want digital copies to expire.
4598
ill stick to linux, torrenting and explicitly avoiding netflix.
4599
i don't support overcharging, forced incompatibility or repurchasing content i already have.
4600
Exactly how much do these artists/record executives/RIAA think their songs are worth exactly?
4601
the law is too low a bar to set.
4602
We need access to these pricks-in-suits, and they've got the laws written to protect their right to fuck us raw.
4603
Civilization, indeed.
4604
I saw the word "criminal activity" in these comments.
4605
Those people are part of the problem.
4606
I think you've gone and compared apples to oranges here pal
4607
Only in the United States of Avarice.
4608
Because either of these things have anything to do with each other.
4609
Public Service announcement!
4610
US workers can not sue their employers for work injuries period (with the exception of Texas workers that work for a non-subscribing employer).
4611
Instead this is handled by our work comp system.
4612
The work comp system pays all medical bills and most income payments until the worker is better regardless of whose fault the injury was.
4613
tl;dr can't sue employer because work comp pays
4614
The lesson is to download at work.
4615
The ad revenue the blogs are making off this guys pity party exceeds $1,000,000.
4616
Enough already he's fucking guilty.
4617
How are these two examples even remotely related?
4618
How did this get so many upvotes?
4619
Or: company gets fined $675,000 for intentionally cutting off a worker's fingers student gets fined $2,000 for accidentally sharing 31 songs
4620
Yeahbut the guy at the pizza place was stoned.
4621
Believe me, I've done the job.
4622
We're all stoned.
4623
Always.
4624
.appears suspect does it not?
4625
Well done elitists.
4626
He essentially stole 2 CDs worth of music (90s kid here) and got fined $675,000!
4627
How does one justify?
4628
Yup! Business has very few watch dogs, yet the consumers can get fees for anything.
4629
Take the property management company I recently had to deal with.
4630
If I were late for rent, it's $100 as a late fee.
4631
When they spent an extra two weeks beyond the state allowed maximum before sending me a a security deposit refund, they get no punishment.
4632
That's actually a small OSHA fine as well.
4633
Usually they multiply them based on findings.
4634
Source: I'm an occupational safety and health supervisor for a general contractor in construction.
4635
Omg the horror!quit being about the "man" and about the system!
4636
When the student died at Notre Dame during football practice in the wind storm, OSHA fined Notre Dame $25,000.
4637
A more appropriate comparison would be someone that was caught stealing CDs of the songs and sentenced to 6 mos in jail and a $2500 fine.
4638
This is a terrible, terrible comparison, although I think I know what you are trying to say - and I agree.
4639
It's just that when the pizza company is being fined, that has absolutely nothing to do with lost royalties from the guy not making pizza.
4640
When someone steals a song, they're getting fined for all the lost revenue, not some set fine by an organization.
4641
This is like arguing apples and oranges.
4642
One problem is that no one has ever been sued for downloading songs.
4643
Reddit should have should have a bot to count every time someone posts a misleading topic or a poster who didn't bother to read the article they linked.
4644
Not comparable offenses.
4645
A contrived post.
4646
Lame.
4647
How the hell are the two comparable?
4648
One is a workplace accident.
4649
The other is a wilful violation of the law.
4650
I love their pizza.
4651
Democracy?
4652
Free Market Capitalism?
4653
Nah.
4654
Corporate Neo-Feudalism is more accurate.
4655
between Corporations and the average person Distinction without a difference?
4656
Oh god, fuck this country.
4657
You have no idea do you.
4658
“This election is about economics?
4659
These groups have been hit the hardest.
4660
They may not show up and vote for our candidate but I’d suggest to you they won’t show up and vote for the president either.? What a lying hack author.
4661
Is anyone past the point of respecting DailyKos?
4662
The way this article is written, anyone who didn't already agree wouldn't read past sentence 1.
4663
This is liberal circlejerking at its finest.
4664
Don't flame.
4665
I'm a liberal, and fairly flaming at that, but until Kos can offer content without heavy handed, unprofessional bias-revealing interjections like "Ummmm, really?" and worse, it shouldn't be regarded as more than an ad-laced pile of lib op-eds.
4666
This isn't journalism.
4667
When did Mitt Romney not like birth control, other than not making it free?
4668
In the debate he asked why a state would ever want to outlaw birth control, because that would be dumb.
4669
It's mainly the GOP's stance on birth control and abortion.
4670
They don't want it to be covered by insurance.
4671
Though there are some GOP calling for an outright ban on it (though I doubt that will ever happen).
4672
Also here is some legislation on birth control and contraception he was supporting thanks to user WallyAnti http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ywpvu/aaaaaaandnowmittromneylikesbirthcontroland/c5zjyo9
4673
I am not sure I agree with you that there is a difference.
4674
Contraceptives is considered part of preventative medical care so there is no reason why it shouldn't be included in regular insurance coverage.
4675
It saves the insurance companies a ton of money as well as is recommended by every single doctor for 90 percent of women.
4676
I kind of get the point that the right to be able to use them at all is different from the right to have insurance cover them is slightly a different conversation.
4677
The issuse the GOP has with birth control was clearly not about insurance companies or corporations and organizations being forced to cover birth control.
4678
It was about organizations crying that the insurance company was covering birth control and their "religion" says no to that or whatever the excuse was they came up with at the time.
4679
Because remember insurance companies came forward and said "If you assholes are going to throw a religious fit about this, your dumb, because we are paying for it because it saves us (and in turn you) money, fucking idiots".
4680
And the GOP came back and still said no.
4681
So it was not about organizations being forces to PAY MONEY, MORE MONEY THEN BEFORE, for birth control because insurance companies said "we will pay for it out of our pockets".
4682
It was about wanting to control women, not money (for once).
4683
This is bad reporting and bad politics.
4684
Our country can do better.
4685
Misrepresenting a politicians position to make cheap jabs at him or her is unworthy of the United States.
4686
I'm starting to doubt this.
4687
Fox News, DailyKos, the people upvoting this thread, they exemplify modern American politicism.
4688
It's easier to build more strawmen if you come prepared.
4689
I think you mean /r/REPUBLICANSSUCKAMIRITE?
4690
It's a form of slacktivism.
4691
People can feel good for voting, even if the President doesn't change anything.
4692
I don't trust Mitt Romney and I absolutely do not support him for president, but this must be said: Romney never says that he supports abortion in this.
4693
Don't fall into the dark side of misquoting/taking quotes out of context.
4694
It represents the worst of this nation's political system, and should not be tolerated, regardless of what stance you have on any issue.
4695
Well as far as contraceptives go, I don't think Romney's political view really changed.
4696
People have the right to contraceptives, and they are available at every drug store across the country.
4697
But this right doesn't equate to the government paying for them.
4698
If someone wants contraceptives, he/she should buy them.
4699
They have the right to do so, and that's why they are legal.
4700
Just as any other right, you can practice the right to use contraceptives, but you shouldn't expect the government to give them to you.
4701
The GOP's standpoint on contraceptives is that they are something to be used as an option, not something that is a necessity, and therefore not something the government should provide.
4702
It's a pretty straightforward idea.
4703
This title is simply not true.
4704
He says he supports contraception and that abortion is a complicated issue.
4705
You don't need to be a fan of Romney to understand the article.
4706
Can someone find a video of him contradicting these positions?
4707
Can you please tell me where he "likes" abortion?
4708
Cause I can't seem to find that particular sound bite.
4709
Would love to hear it.
4710
Today is an odd-numbered day: 27.
4711
On odd-numbered days he is a liberal and on even numbered days he is a conservative.
4712
I want 'Romneycare' to go federal.
4713
Abortions for some, miniature american flags for others.
4714
There have been so many times watching Mitt Romney this campaign season where the guy looked like he just wanted to hop out of his own body and run the hell away.
4715
I think this is the first time I've seen him talk where he looked comfortable with what he was saying.
4716
I'd like to see more of that.
4717
Less of the etch-a-sketch and more of what he actually believes and what he would do as president.
4718
Article is awfully written.
4719
Can we just get direct links to the youtube video next time?
4720
Umm wait, so people are still letting him spout that 715 billion in medicare cuts less-than-a-quarter-true bullshit like its a fact?
4721
He just slipped it in there, did anyone else hear it?
4722
edit:less confusingnessly
4723
Did people just not watch the video?
4724
He does not say anything at all about being pro-choice.
4725
Not.
4726
At.
4727
All.
4728
The Romney camp runs like a silicon valley startup that hasn't figured out how to generate revenue yet.
4729
Misleading title, sensationalized article.
4730
You can't complain about fox news if you post shit like this.
4731
Downvoted for a misleading title.
4732
This is literally the same stuff Romney has been saying the entire race.
4733
Your willingness to completely disregard facts in order to make cheap political points is dragging Reddit and /r/politics down.
4734
Take this garbage to the Huffington Post.
4735
Romney makes Kerry's flip-flopping look like amateur hour.
4736
With regard to contraception, he didn't change his position.
4737
He thinks now, as he thought before, that people have a "right to use" contraception, rather than a "right to" contraception.
4738
Conservatives try to make it about whether people have the "right" to expect something for free.
4739
We should not fall into the trap of even arguing those things; cheap or free contraception is good policy.
4740
Who cares if people think it is a right or not, as long as it saves us money?
4741
That is where Mitt Romney is still wrong, just as he was wrong before.
4742
But there is no reason to think that his position has changed.
4743
Finally someone who doesn't oversimplify every politicians stance.
4744
I see this as a win.
4745
He might be a indecisive bitch but at least he has a good idea this time.
4746
You know, there's another article in this sub Reddit where Paul Ryan is saying that rape is just another form of conception.
4747
It seems that they're playing good cop bad cop.
4748
Romney is going to talk to the middle and Ryan is going to talk to the extreme right.
4749
one thing i think that was ignored was the end comment.
4750
I have to agree with Romney there in that all of this mudslinging is stymieing national progress and development at the real issues on hand.
4751
Even though, given the chance, I think the governor would indulge in the same activities
4752
No, of course we won't post the WHOLE interview.
4753
We'll just take pieces out of context.
4754
Yes, that seems perfectly fair.
4755
Aaaaaaand now I wasted 3 minutes watching this video because Romney doesn't like abortion.
4756
I'd like to see the blooper reel for this interview.
4757
Actually, think Romney came off decent in this.
4758
Of course, the blatant lie about Obama cutting Medicare should make him embarrassed to criticize anything that the Obama campaign does.
4759
Well, that was the most poorly written article I ever read.
4760
It was painful to try to get through.
4761
It gets a downvote from me because it is so horrible and seems to be written with so much rage I can't hardly understand it.
4762
I think he's changed is mind about this right?
4763
I'm pretty sure they released a statement or something
4764
Un-fucking-believable.
4765
I love the part where they cut to the commercial with Akin on the Romney-Ryan ticket and the Fox News logo is conveniently over the "not" of the "not endorsed by any candidate."
4766
http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/yxujz/everytimeiseemittromneyspeak/
4767
But wait, there's more!
4768
If this guys wins my first response will be "HA HA" America.
4769
i hope your second thought is pity for us Americans
4770
When I watch that all I can think is "LIARRRRRRRRR!11!111!"
4771
He didn't, whatsoever address the fucking issues.
4772
All he said was that different people had different views, and that they regard it with seriousness and sobriety.
4773
Also, that not only men are pro-life, but women too.
4774
My head hurts.
4775
I'm so confused.
4776
I hope the Republicans steal the election.
4777
This fucking guy.
4778
He has no principles at all.
4779
He's changing his tone now, to be reasonable because he knows his base is all shored up.
4780
Maybe the title is misleading, but only a little.
4781
What's more misleading is the way this douche can flip his rhetoric to fit whomever he is sitting across from or what part of his election roadmap he is on.
4782
Can we get one thing straight here?
4783
In regard to contraceptives, the republican party simply is opposed to requiring health insurance companies to provide coverage of them.
4784
Just like they would be opposed to forcing every deli to sell ham or forcing every Home Depot to sell hammers.
4785
Doesn't mean they don't believe people should have the right to eat ham or use hammers.
4786
I agree with Mitt Romney on some of the things he said in this video.
4787
Obama 2012
4788
And with regards to the issue of abortion, that is something where men and women have alternative views on that or different views.
4789
What?
4790
How?
4791
I mean.
4792
Anyone have a stopwatch?
4793
I want to time how fast his position switches.
4794
It appears the intervals in which he switches positions seems to shorten each time.
4795
Soon he'll be in a continuous state of flux.
4796
He'll be neither for or against anything at any given point in time.
4797
Schrödinger's Mittens
4798
.once again attacking Republicans for what they call the so-called war on women.
4799
That was clumsy and redundant.
4800
It really lessens the impact of the article when stuff like that jumps out at you.
4801
Y'all would've been just as mad if he hadn't changed positions.
4802
What are we going to be mad at Romney for today?
4803
Flip-flopping or holding conservative views?
4804
This article completely misses the reasons Republicans have been fighting Planned Parenthood and contraception.
4805
And it over-generalizes their views.
4806
They weren't fighting contraception itself.
4807
They didn't want to force everyone to offer contraception, because there are some institutions (that are Republican leaning) that don't believe in birth control.
4808
As for defunding Planned Parenthood, it's because they do abortions.
4809
Federal funding may not go towards abortions, but Republicans hate Planned Parenthood because you can get an abortion there.
4810
It's not about fucking contraception.
4811
Look.
4812
Romney is a flip flopper and there's no shortage of material to use against him.
4813
So to make completely flawed arguments like they're doing in this article is ridiculous.
4814
I'm not even conservative and I can rip this shit apart without thinking twice.
4815
If you want to win in November, YOU MUST DO BETTER.
4816
Well I like it, if you like it.
4817
I mean if you don't like, I don't have to like it.
4818
I like it but I don't dislike it.
4819
I mean, I'm ok with it if your ok with it, but if you're not ok with me being ok then I can be not ok with it.
4820
if that's ok with you.
4821
State government healthcare vs. Federal government healthcare.
4822
While plenty of people are against Obamacare simply because its Obamacare, the 'states should have this power but the federal government shouldn't' is a real debate.
4823
I'm not making the argument for myself, but one could support Romneycare and not Obamacare.
4824
clap ON; clap OFF
4825
his mood ring must be going fucking berserk!
4826
This woman is not real right?
4827
Like people have to be making this woman up out of thin air.
4828
Right?
4829
Oh right Money.
4830
Honestly what does this report even matter?
4831
Yes, OK, people have already responded that there are several ecological niches in which mosquitoes are important, just not with positive relevance to humans, and in my opinion, I agree.
4832
But so what?
4833
Honestly even if the article is correct, are they all of a sudden going to start being able to commit genocide on mosquitoes because of this lame article?
4834
I met John Boehner once.no
4835
I didn't
4836
I am starting to think that she is a Grandmaster troll, like on an Andy Kaufman level.
4837
Did anyone else notice that article is 5 years old?
4838
The best troll.
4839
Ann Coulter could make Hugh Hefner want to be gay.
4840
Why only take women's vote?
4841
Minorities vote democratic too.
4842
Only the wealthy white males should be allowed to vote.
4843
If Ann Coulter actually believed what she said, she would be barefoot, naked and in the kitchen, keeping her fat mouth shut and focusing on getting me a beer and and a sandwich, if she knew what was best for her.
4844
You know what I love about posts regarding Ann Coulter?
4845
How half the comments are ad hominem attacks referring to her perceived gender and sexual characteristics.
4846
Because she certainly hasn't said enough crazy things that can be taken on their own merit, it's good that we're able to fall back on vaguely misogynistic and/or transphobic attacks on her physical appearance.
4847
/s
4848
You wonder if Ann Coulter actually knows how to read.
4849
Here is a list of Democratic Presidents before women got the right to vote: Andrew Jackson Martin Van Buren James Polk Franklin Pierce James Buchanan Andrew Johnson Grover Cleveland Woodrow Wilson Actually the ratio of elected Democrats and Republicans hasn't changed since women go the right to vote.
4850
In other words, in addition to being offensive, Ann Coulter is also incorrect in her assertion.
4851
God, she's like an evil robot made in an ignorant hate factory.
4852
And if we took away Christians' right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Republican president.
4853
I'm not convinced that Ann Coulter isn't just trolling.
4854
She dated Bill Maher and half the shit she says is disavowed even by conservatives.
4855
This article is from 2007.but
4856
I like it here.
4857
If we required an IQ of at least 100 to vote we would never have another Republican president.
4858
Is it me or is the Christian right becoming just like the Muslim right?
4859
In almost every way?
4860
And that they say they are fighting against Muslim extremists but what about Christian extremists in their own party?
4861
More to the point, why don't the left mention this.
4862
Well besides it frustrates the right-wing in this country to be compared to terrorist when they are that anyways.
4863
Why stop with women?
4864
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap-tSd5aulM&feature=related
4865
If we took away everyone else's right to vote, but mine; we'd never have to worry about another President who isn't me.
4866
If people haven't figured out by now that Ann Coulter continues to remain relevant by saying shit she can't possibly agree with, they need their heads checked.
4867
The full quote is really what did it for me: If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president.
4868
It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen.
4869
And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.
4870
It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it.
4871
I mean, you do see it’s the party of women and 'We’ll pay for health care and tuition and day care ?
4872
and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?' She's flat out saying that Democrats should be ashamed they can only get votes of women because they are so stupid.
4873
this cunt makes the case for retroactive abortion P
4874
well, she does have a point
4875
Except Obama won the male vote in 2008, and actually still would have won a landslide election in the electoral college even if you threw out every female vote (would have only given up indiana, north carolina and coloardo).
4876
Does.does she realize that SHE'S a woman?
4877
"Ann Coulter" is now the Women's Lib equivalent of "Uncle Tom".
4878
May her name forever be associated with the shame she so richly deserves.
4879
I'm sorry, but if someone stood up in the UK and said things like that, they'd be laughed off the political stage.
4880
We wouldn't have to worry about living in a democracy either, who exactly does she think has the right to remove half the countries voters from having a say in who represents them?
4881
Ann's a troll, this has long been established, but she does play a role in trying to shape public opinion.
4882
Behind the scenes there are people considering whether this is possible or not.
4883
Why stop at just disenfranchising a few voters.
4884
In related news, the crazy guy on the street corner said that women who wear pants are whores will will burn in a lake of fire.
4885
The only reason she get's any attention at all is because of people like yourself give her words weight by promoting them.
4886
Remember that whole thing about not promoting crazy shooters?
4887
Same thing applies here.
4888
Guys, I totally thought this was a circlejerk post.
4889
Wat.
4890
SIGH.
4891
On why global warming is religion on the left: Because we can't prove them wrong for a thousand years, and I think the other thing about it is, it goes back to Chesterton’s statement: that when people stop believing in God, the problem isn't that they believe in nothing, it's that they'll believe anything.
4892
And that's what you constantly see with people who don't believe in God: They're always imitating the most ridiculous, primitive religions.
4893
And it is like a primitive religion, thinking if we just change these lightbulbs, we can change the temperature of the ocean.
4894
It's the craziest thing!
4895
Even primitive people wouldn't believe something that silly.
4896
Goddamnit, why are women allowing this kind of treatment?
4897
Does anybody give a crap about these women?
4898
Rape isn't enough, the rapist asshole can take her to court!
4899
I'm sick of this garbage!
4900
I'm writing my DEMOCRATIC congressman.
4901
season finale.
4902
sadness :(
4903
The vote tally did not only deviate greatly from the exit polling, but in precincts that vote overwhelmingly Democrat, a large percentage of ballots were basically a "straight" Democrat ticket.
4904
without any vote cast for President.
4905
The exit polling is what most people focused on, because Ohio 2004 is the only time in modern history where there was a significant disparity between exit polling results and the vote tally.
4906
People explain away the exit polling anomaly as sampling error and people not being truthful about how their votes were cast.
4907
To me, the number of ballots with no choice for President made much more of an impression.
4908
I am not aware of any mildly plausible explanation for why so many people failed to cast any vote for President.
4909
Turnouts for Presidential elections is much higher than off-year elections, yet in key precincts in Ohio, people stood for long hours in line to vote but didn't vote for any Presidential candidate.
4910
The other anomaly that I haven't heard or thought much about from Ohio 2004 is that in some precincts the number of votes cast exceeded 100% of registered voters.
4911
Some people say this is related to voter ID efforts in Ohio.
4912
Michael Connell Note that the lead prosecutor had sought protection for Mr. Connell as his life was threatened.
4913
And sending vote tabulations to a server in Tennessee?
4914
As the article stated, classic man in the middle technique.
4915
Why were vote tabulations sent out of state?
4916
To private servers?
4917
Who threatened the life of Michael Connell?
4918
How does a pilot with as much experience flying in that air space confused by flying through a cloud when no malfunctions in equipment were present?
4919
Too many coincidences.
4920
I voted in Ohio in 2004, in a liberal town in an otherwise very Republican area -- I was a student at Kenyon College.
4921
I waited over 11 hours to vote, and had national news crews on scene, pizza delivered by the governor, and more.
4922
There can be zero doubt that those motherfuckers were trying to fix the election -- the town had eight modern-ish voting machines, but the college township only had two old ones, despite being significantly larger.
4923
One of those two broke.
4924
I don't know how widespread that type of shit was, but I do know that my vote of 11 hours was never even officially counted.
4925
Because fuck rights, eh?
4926
So is that setup still in place?
4927
Has anything been done to prevent this from happening again in Ohio?
4928
What the hell is wrong with paper ballots and counting?
4929
I mean it's not like you vote every week and it is kind of important.
4930
Why would anyone let any sort of hackable computer anywhere near this process?
4931
Electronic voting should be illegal.
4932
To me this is one of the highest forms of treason someone could commit against a democracy.
4933
It undermines the entire fucking process.
4934
And I am not using the word treason lightly.
4935
I think this shit should be a capital offense.
4936
It's like I always say.democrats will wait until after they lose the election to get worked up about this.
4937
Ohio is one of the most important states obviously and the GOP knows all they have to do is hijack PA, OH, VA and FL election results and they're basically in.
4938
All of the campaigning, all of the money spent, all of the debates and commercials.all of that is literally nullified with a few strategically placed election officials in the right states.
4939
And apparently the GOP can hijack all of that an commandeer it but the democrats can't do anything to block that or stop it?
4940
No wonder the GOP always wins.
4941
They're willing to bring a gun to knife fight and the dems are sitting at home thinking, 'I don't know.this
4942
knife may be too sharp to take."
4943
Get your heads out of your asses, democratic officials in the respective states.
4944
The country has already been hijacked.let's
4945
at least pretend that the leader we get was actually elected.
4946
edit: currently 36 downvotes and nobody arguing it.
4947
Like typical republicans, they're just trying to stifle information rather than somehow justify their opinions.
4948
As usual.
4949
I wonder what part of the Bible makes it ok to falsify elections and lie constantly.
4950
The GOP seems to be pretty down with that part.
4951
Ken Blackwell, who was deeply involved in this, is well-known political scumbag in Ohio politics.
4952
He's even hated by a lot of Republicans.
4953
In other words, the election of Bush as President is more illegitimate than Obama's birth certificate (which is legitimate).
4954
"Oh and the programmer that was about to testify on this died mysteriously."
4955
So he had a heart attack, while falling out of a plane, and nicked a carotid artery while shaving?
4956
I keep telling people Bush was never legitimately elected and they act like I've gone a little soft in the head.
4957
The concept of a free and democratic nation isn't an option to the top lawmakers/advisors.
4958
The people say and want one thing.
4959
The top delivers another through smoke and mirrors.
4960
Sounds like the plot to the movie, Man of the Year.
4961
He was basically saying that despite what opinion polls are indicating, given how hard these groups were hit he believes that they won't be voting for either candidate.
4962
This is Fox News level misleading.
4963
I read the entire article twice, but I missed the part where he said "I'm hoping blacks and latinos don't show up."
4964
Your title is blatantly misleading.
4965
The phrase ".suggest to you they wont."
4966
clearly indicates to anyone with a grasp of the English language that he is making a prediction.
4967
Another misleading headline where someone is quoted as saying something they didn't say.
4968
WTF.
4969
that doesn't seem to be what he said.
4970
he's a douche, but the title is misleading.
4971
What he said is that it's likely they won't show up.
4972
I don't think he's too far off.
4973
Dear Reddit liberals, THIS is the reason the non-liberals think you are a complete joke.

Nothing you say here matters when threads like this get upvoted.
4975
You aren't any better than the people you detest.
4976
Love, an Independent.
4977
Definitely not what he said.
4978
I guess you could say he implied it, or you could infer it from his comments.
4979
“This election is about economics,?
4980
Boehner said.
4981
“These groups have been hit the hardest.
4982
They may not show up and vote for our candidate but I’d suggest to you they won’t show up and vote for the president either.?
4983
Come on, at this rate you guys will be no better than.
4984
than.
4985
than Fox News
4986
I hoped Boehner said that, but he didn't.
4987
I read the article.
4988
Twice.
4989
The agenda is clear.
4990
The article isn't bad and the headline isn't really wrong.Vote.
4991
Show up and vote.
4992
That's what really matters.
4993
Another great quote: "I'm an imbecile that goes horrendously out of my way to skew something someone said, so that I can get article views by having a shocking title."

4995
Not only is that not what he said, it's really not even that bad if he did.
4996
Blacks and Latinos vote mainly democratic.
4997
If Barack Obama said "I hope the republicans don't show up for the election," I don't think many people would be mad.
4998
I hope Speaker Boehner finishes turning back into a pumpkin soon.
4999
I had the impression that he'd been muzzled by someone - he's been so quiet.
5000
Now I know why they want him to keep his mouth shut.
5001
What an asshole!
5002
Would you expect less from the GOP!
5003
Yeah, but looks like the Boehner asshole didn't say anything assholey this time, just make a statement that'll probably be true.
5004
But we're not at the nitty gritty.
5005
Vatos and homeboys might vote.
5006
The obvious counter to that is "If you believe that, why would you vote for the people who not only think that gay marriage causes hurricanes, but legislates on ideas like that?"
5007
RINO!
5008
To be fair, this is fiction.
5009
Sadly, republicans do not think this in the real world.
5010
Put this on the front page.
5011
Make other media outlets talk about it!
5012
Boehner is absolutely a tool by any measure, but I'm getting pretty fucking tired of seeing shit like this on r/politics.
5013
Boehner says nothing of the sort in that quote - he says that he doesn't think they are going to show up to vote for Obama.
5014
As in, "I think they're getting hit really hard by the economy right now, so I think that's going to push them away from re-electing Obama because they may perceive that he's not doing enough to fix the problem".
5015
It's a small but critical distinction.
5016
Now, I'm 100% sure that really does hope that blacks and latinos don't show up to vote, but that's not what he said in this quote.
5017
I thought Republicans had close to a monopoly on taking things out of context and making shit up, but this is getting ridiculous.
5018
If you read the quotes IN THIS ARTICLE you'll see he doesn't actually say that.
5019
He's saying he doesn't expect them to vote.
5020
As much as I dislike Boehner, I don't think that's what he means.
5021
He's probably just guessing that minorities won't vote, not that he hopes they won't vote.
5022
Don't be like the conservatives and make this into something it's not.
5023
("You didn't build that!")
5024
We're better than that.
5025

I'm a little confused.
5034
Aren't their restrictions on sexual predators being around children even if the victim(s) weren't underage?
5035
I don't understand why a person convicted of a sexual crime wouldn't be allowed with 500 ft of a place where children congregate but can be granted visitation and even in some cases custody.
5036
While I don't consider this to be "right" at all, I might consider it "fair" given that male victims of (statutory) rape can be hit up for child support payments.
5037
Umm. Duh!
5038

After a girlfriend was tested for chlamydia, I went in an got myself tested.
5049
The doctor twisted what can only be described as a pipe cleaner down my dick hole, it was fucking painful as hell.
5050
He said he was going to count to 10 and he was twisting while he counted.
5051
I immediately went 7-8-9-10 only to hear the doctor say 2.3.4, it was like slow motion.
5052
Anyway, I tested clear and our relationship went to shit soon after.
5053
THIS HAPPENED TO ME! My wife had a positive Chlamydia test during routine pregnancy checkups and of course all eyes were on me.
5054
Luckily her OB/GYN (a female) had once had a previous case of a positive test where it was extremely unlikely for either partner to have been unfaithful.
5055
She told my wife "Look, you're three months, pregnant, are you going to throw it all away over this?"
5056
It blew over and we still joke about who was catting around with someone nasty enough to be carrying chlamydia.
5057
If they can perfect the technology in humans I might get one eye redone.

5090
Mis-leading title, you got me really excited for a second.
5091
So dark matter doesn't "exist" then for the hard science "I'm so logical" crowd, correct?
5092
How does the mantra go? "if it can't be measured it doesn't exist."
5093
Yes, this was tongue-in-cheek.
5094
Can't wait for the day when scientists trap a piece of dark matter in a lab somewhere to study it.
5095
Might not happen for hundreds or thousands of years.
5096
So is dark matter supposed to be made of some new element(s), or is it a special state of already known substances?
5097
Also, I've read before there should be some just kind of floating around near earth, so is there no way to send a mission to capture some?
5098
ITT: armchair physicists tell us how much dark matter doesn't exist.
5099
Others describe how this isn't "direct detection" without making it clear what would qualify as "direct detection" if this doesn't--since the only way for us to detect dark matter at all is through its gravitational interactions.
5100
Many of the same people breathlessly excited about the Higgs announcement at CERN assume physicists are idiots who are just making shit up when postulating the existence of dark matter, and do not notice the cognitive dissonance slowly producing an aneurysm deep in their brain.
5101
Published on Jul 09, 2012 Okay, I thought I had read this before.
5102
yea, direct detection or even theoretical prediction would be game changing
5103
So many wrong facts quoted in the first couple of paragraphs that i don't trust this website as a reliable source of information.
5104
Firstly, it says that there is twice as much dark matter in the universe than matter.
5105
Secondly, they also say that dark matter makes up more than 80% of the universe.
5106
Both these facts are wrong.
5107
Matter makes 4% of the universe and dark matter makes 27% of the universe only.
5108
Ok, if dark matter comprises more of the universe than visible matter, how should we visualize it?
5109
Does it fill up the entire void, so that space is no longer space but a mass of invisible stuff punctuated by masses of visible stuff?
5110
Or is it floating tendrils of unidentified stuff that theoretically explains the movement of identifiable stuff?
5111
Basically do we know enough about it to designate it as the explanation for cosmic activity?

Man do I feel dumb.
5119
every single time i see a thread from this sub that seems interesting I know I'm going to get buzz-killed by the top comment as soon as I click didn't dissapoint.
5120
well, it did, as usual.
5121
Can a someone explain this statement, " focused on a peculiar cluster system whose axis is oriented toward Earth, so that the lensing effects could be magnified."
5122
in details? How did they determine that axis of huge galaxy cluster?
5123
I actually went to meet Dr. Dietrich for research 6 months ago, very cool person.
5124
"The gravity of massive objects such as galaxy clusters acts as a lens to bend and distort the light from more distant objects as it passes.
5125
Dietrich's team observed tens of thousands of galaxies beyond the supercluster.
5126
They were able to determine the extent to which the supercluster distorted galaxies, and with that information, they could plot the gravitational field and the mass of the Abell 222 and 223 clusters" Ok, I'm missing the "direct" detection there.
5127
Also, using gravitational lensing to support the notion that DM is present isn't new.
5128
Can someone explain to me why this . . .
5129
matters?
5130
If we detected dark matter, would it no longer be "dark" and just another form of matter?
5131
"Does this mean we can make bombs with 100 percent efficiency?" "No, that's antimatter" "Then why do we care about this?" "Because uuumm.you
5132
know what, I don't know."
5133
Even with the misleading title and fluff like qualities of this piece, I have to say the obligatory GO BLUE!
5134
This may be a stupid question, but how do we know that this is actually "dark matter" causing this gravitational lensing?
5135
Could it not be say, a lot of brown dwarfs, or other objects that also don't emit light?
5136
I think it came out of Snooki's vag.
5137
This article is relatively old.
5138
Why are we only seeing this now on reddit?
5139
Is it just me, or does "Dark Matter" sound like total bullshit?
5140
Dark matter has been known to exist for a long time(since the late 60s).
5141
The model of the galaxy was based on adding invisible particles that have 5 times the weight of the "visible" matter.
5142
This is just a better and more accurate map of the dark matter.
5143
This kind of detection is called indirect.
5144
We know that matter is there indirectly because of the way the matter warps the path of light, but no light actually bounces off dark matter particles.
5145
Dark matter has only ever been detected indirectly, and indeed was proposed because of such indirect evidence.
5146
Direct evidence for the sun is sunlight.
5147
Direct evidence for Jupiter is sunlight bouncing off of Jupiter.
5148
Indirect evidence for the sun would be detecting the distortion of light from stars behind the sun.
5149
We have matter that doesn't give off light here on earth: dust, rocks, people.
5150
I think the interesting question is. is dark matter a different kind of matter than that.
5151
Didn't this happen a long time ago, the same day as the Higgs-Boson reveal?
5152
"Prepare for unforeseen consequences."
5153
I've done little reading on dark matter, but I was hoping someone could let me know if this conclusion of mine is true (at all) - dark matter is the part of the universe that isn't space.
5154
Meaning, dark matter is everywhere in the universe where matter can not go, not even light (maybe light is matter, idk tbh).
5155
We can not see or even detect this dark matter because light isn't reflected off it, something which happens to basically everything else in the universe.
5156
Basically, what I'm saying is that dark matter is "nothing-ness".
5157
And I mean nothingness in the strictest sense of the word.
5158
Outerspace with no rock chunks would still NOT be considered nothing-ness because rocks or other matter COULD potentially occupy outerspace.
5159
On the other hand, dark matter is just dark matter and nothing else can go there, let alone see it.
5160
Gravitational lensing of DM filaments.
5161
Very interesting, adds information about LSS, but is so far from direct detection of DM.
5162
Great.
5163
Next we'll actually see the Reapers, and then it's all over.
5164
Dumb question: Isn't dark matter thusly names as it is not detected/accounted for?
5165
Wouldn't this simply be 'detected matter'?
5166
I can't seem to find much on Reddit about the Electric Universe theory.
5167
Can anyone explain to me why this is dismissed?
5168
Even articles like this one do not seem to dispel it for me.
5169
How long have they been working on this?
5170
I read an article on dark matter and gravitational lensing around a year ago.
5171
I wish somebody would sum this up for people who arent astro-physicists
5172
I like the theory that dark matter isn't just matter we can't see, but that it's the gravitational signature of matter in parallel universes.
5173
Imagine you have a thin piece of wood and there are magnets on each side.
5174
If you could only see one side of the piece of wood (our universe), you'd have a hard time explaining the magnets' behavior.
5175
They'd be interacting with the invisible magnets on the other side of the barrier and they'd all be getting pulled together.
5176
The force pulling the magnets together would be stronger than you could account for by just looking at one side.
5177
Basically gravity can seep through the barrier between parallel universes the same way magnetic fields could penetrate a piece of wood.
5178
That's why galaxies don't spin apart (they should, according to Newtonian physics, given the matter we can see in them) and why clusters form the way they do.
5179
Gravity itself is a higher dimension or it can at least travel via a higher dimension, between universes in a multiverse, all superimposed in hyperspace.
5180
That theory gives me a mental boner.
5181
Leaders and the best!
5182
Where the hell is Lyra?
5183
No. They did not detect or see dark matter.
5184
As always when it is announced that dark matter has been found, only gravitational anomalies have been observed.
5185
Such anomalies are always explained by kludging in dark matter.
5186
Seems a little convenient.
5187
Jörg rhymes with Borg, r/conspiracy here I come.
5188
Who else is thinking that Dark Matter is actually the mass in hyperspace, where most of the civilizations live and fight.
5189
The 4% of the Universe we are seeing is a rarity, and the real action is in hyper space where 96% matter and energy live.
5190
I think Quasars are regions where Hyperspace and Normal Space meet.
5191
If am crazy, sorry.
5192
What do you think of that Ohio state?
5193
Go wolverines
5194
Downvote for misleading/incorrect title.
5195
How does one detect something that isn't there?
5196
If this doesn't help, I can try to explain in a different way, but read that if you'd like.
5197
Now we can all bullet-proof our cars with the bullet proof spray, "Lead-away!"* *patent pending.
5198
srs business.
5199
This will be very practical in the upcoming years and has the capacity to save many lives.
5200
Might make a niffty prostectic, or could replace silicon, or protect vulnerable wire.
5201
Well, I don't know about DNA, but I always thought RNA existed before life.
5202
That makes sense, because nucleic acids have enzymatic properties.
5203
Scientists "buzzword" human brain.
5204
Dear Government, Please stay the hell out of my brain.
5205
| University of Oxford in Geneva Since when has Oxford been in Geneva?
5206
I am so tired of headlines like this.
5207
Seriously?I don't even know why I'm in /r/science.
5208
If those that govern this nation (and others) sit idly and do nothing when confronted with the realities of climate change (which has been around for decades).
5209
when this study of ecology in the US (namely, that bilogical systems are deteriorating) is completed, it will just be another scientific conspiracy.
5210
Our leaders are far to short-sighted.
5211
But hey, at least some graduate students will have some good thesis material to work on.
5212
But lets wait until we get about another 10,000 fracking wells drilled!
5213
By the time it's complete the human world will be self imploding.
5214
finding money for it wasnt easy I dont think most americans find it a good idea to pay 5 dollars for something they may never use.
5215
This study is a fools task.
5216
By the end of 30 years America will have no natural ecology.
5217
Already all large American mammals have but one purpose - to meet death by a bullet.
5218
Can this stuff be attacked by fungi and if not why not?
5219
Do I understand the article right when they say that the big yellow ball of thermo-nuclear plasma hanging above our heads' the cause for temperature drops, and not increases, in seeming contradiction with my (admitedly a bit remote) thermodynamics courses ?
5220
As for a food thickener as was mentioned at the end of the article, I seriously doubt it.
5221
The reason is that we already have a low-cost cellulose based food thickener that is used in many foods and that is also used as an ingredient in water-based lubricants.
5222
It's called carboxymethylcellulose or CMC.
5223
CMC is extremely low cost.
5224
I doubt a product prepared as mentioned in this article could compete on a cost basis with CMC.
5225
Sadly, further development of this concept will just be one more incentive to deforest the planet.
5226
Note well that the study doesn't imply energy drinks improve heart health.
5227
The study only demonstrates an increase in cardiac output.
5228
From my understanding, it's best to treat these drinks as what they are: sweetened caffeine and multivitamins.
5229
Actually they are cold cups of fruity flavored coffee with some b6 and b12 vitamins.
5230
You could make a cup of coffee yourself and take a b6 and b12 vitamin and have most of the cash to spare.
5231
B6 and b12 give you back a lot of energy that you loose as you age.
5232
That means you are more active thus pushing your muscles and thus blood flow.
5233
Kind of a crappy title.
5234
Like saying running leads to an acute increase in heart function.
5235
and yet another study reveals they will lead to type 2 diabetes if consumed frequently.
5236
(not really, but i'm sure a study will come out in the future)
5237
(Everytime Nasa does that, a tiny bit of me hopes for some world-shattering catastrophic announcement to happen.
5238
)
5239
One of the main pieces of evidence for the expanding universe theory is the red shift, correct?
5240
I've had this theory in the past (about 10 years ago): Is it possible that the redshift is actually caused by light being sucked tward us into a supermassive black hole at the center of our universe, and that we're being sucked into it as well?
5241
racists
5242
NPR seems to have sensationalized the AAP's stance a bit.
5243
From their policy statement: Although health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns, the benefits of circumcision are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns.
5244
All they're saying is they see no reason to ban it like Germany did since they now officially recognize the fact that there are indeed health benefits to doing it, which to me doesn't seem like anything new.
5245
Apparently the "ban" in Germany is a bit more complicated than I thought.
5246
Read the replies below (like this one or this one).

5255
EDIT4: Phew, okay.
5256
One last thing that I think some people are misunderstanding about my contention with NPR's article.
5257
I'll start with another quote from the AAP policy statement: Systematic evaluation of English-language peer-reviewed literature from 1995 through 2010 indicates that preventive health benets of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure.
5258
The AAP is saying there are health benefits for those who want to circumcise their children, not that everyone should circumcise their children because of these health benefits, which, IMO, is what the NPR article is implying.
5259
Nowhere has the AAP said that those health benefits justified circumcising all males.
5260
The health benefits only outweigh the risks of the procedure; the health benefits do NOT outweigh not being circumcised.
5261
Precisely.
5262
That's the newsworthy part.
5263
The sensationalism comes in when NPR decided to downplay that aspect of the story and make it seem like the AAP was endorsing male circumcision across the board when they aren't.
5264
the important point to note is the line "to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns" the purpose of this stance is to say that circumcision is not just a cosmetic procedure but that is has health benefits and insurance companies can not deny paying for it because it is a medical procedure not a cosmetic procedure.
5265
This report has nothing to do with saying whether you should or should not circumcise but that insurance companies should have to pay for it if the family chooses to do it
5266
Highjacking the top comment.I feel dirty.
5267
PLEASE quit reporting comments simply because you disagree with them.
5268
It is not "banned" in Germany yet.
5269
A judge deemed it incompatible with current german law.
5270
Basically it was ruled that the babies right to bodily integrity overrides the right of parental determination and the right to free practice of religion of the parents.
5271
The ruling didnt evaluate possible health benefits yet, just made a ruling on circumcisions that arent medically indicated.
5272
Thus, circumcision can be seen as a mistreatment.
5273
It isn't quite illegal, more of a grey zone.
5274
Doctors might get prosecuted now.
5275
Our parliament is in the process of writing a law that excludes medically unnecessary circumcision from the right to bodily integrity.
5276
Probably because females whose genitals are mutilated are forced into one-partner relationships their whole lives, and don't enjoy having sex as much.
5277
If you cut the nerves out of my dick, I'd be much less likely to get HIV in my lifetime, too.
5278
As an inanimate rubber dildo, I don't want anyone taking an exacto knife to me.
5279
Me too.
5280
Apparently, I'm the product of an abusive household, my dick mutilated by religious extremists, and my doctor & nonreligious parents should've been jailed.
5281
I fear I may be too old for foster care :(
5282
The problem is really that most of the supposed benefits are equal only to actually having good hygiene, and not having unprotected sex with untested strangers.
5283
The whole idea of getting circumcised just to lower your risk of getting HIV is friggin' insane, and the only reason they even promote it is because they're assuming you're gonna go and do the wrong thing.
5284
And the reduction in UTIs, while it may sound like an impressive reduction is actually not a particularly great absolute risk reduction since your absolute risk of getting a UTI as a male is pretty low if you don't have any congenital abnormalities.
5285
To be honest though I remember talking with parents regarding whether or not to circumcise their kids and most of the time people just did it so they'd look like their dad, and not because of any health things one way the other.
5286
Personally I'd probably focus more on actually teaching parents about proper hygiene and stuff.
5287
The circumcisions that I had to see were pretty horrifying to see-especially when they couldn't get good local anesthesia-they have these little plastic tubs that they strap the babies down in so they can't move and then the metal cutting devices come out.and
5288
you're forcibly breaking the connections between the glans and the foreskin that are supposed to be intact until halfway through your childhood.
5289
Seriously, I doubt that many parents would really let their kids get circumcised if they had to actually witness the procedure but they almost never have to see it.
5290
Now I haven't ever witnessed a religious circumcision so I don't know if it's less horrifying or what, but it was seriously disturbing for me to see, and I also saw at least 3 kids who had botched circumcision jobs one way or the other (though I have to say leaving it too long is much better than leaving it too short since at least you can fix it pretty easily).
5291
The UTI thing kinda cracks me up.
5292
Females have a much higher rate of UTIs than males.
5293
But let's worry about reducing that small rate.
5294
It isn't a miracle that my son has never had a UTI despite still having a foreskin.
5295
Guess what, my daughters haven't either.
5296
And if any of them had, there are treatments for it.
5297
I'm always wary of articles that tout 90% reduction in risk without telling you the original risk factor.
5298
From the most recent study Source The 1-year probabilities of hospital admission for UTI were 1.88 per 1000 person-years of observation (83 cases up to end of follow-up) in the circumcised cohort and 7.02 per 1000 person-years (247 cases up to end of follow-up) in the uncircumcised cohort (p0.0001).
5299
In other words the risk of UTI is reduced by 0.514%, from 0.702% to 0.188%.
5300
Like this, or any other, ethical debate will be solved by scientific evidence.
5301
Point is that the positions are already taken, usually pre-determined by what happened in your own family, and people are just rehashing the same arguments over and over again.
5302
Pretty much this.
5303
People usually argue the ethics of infant circumcision, rather than the benefits and detriments.
5304
While scientific papers- be they accurate or not- add fuel to the fire, nothing will change.
5305
Well that's probably because a lot of people see it as an ethical problem first and foremost.
5306
Honestly, I doubt any benefit short of adding years to your life would be enough to convince me to have it done to my child.
5307
The only reason circumcision is so accepted is because it has been going on for so damn long.
5308
I remember seeing an African tradition where they rolled hot bars of metal across young girls' breasts to prevent them from growing or something.
5309
It seems barbaric to us, so we don't bother trying to find possible benefits or justifying the parent's right to have it done to their children.
5310
I just don't understand why the decision isn't just left for the person to make.
5311
Are UTIs really such a big deal that undergoing a surgical procedure is more safe?
5312
And the fact that they might lower STD rates?
5313
Well that's pretty obviously irrelevant for the first decade or so, and by that point I think most guys would probably rather opt for a condom over voluntarily mutilating their own genitals.
5314
Just a word of warning against loaded language: The rest of your comment was fine in terms of terminology, but at the very end you use "mutilating their own genitals" which carries a pretty big emotional weight.
5315
It's not terminology that paves the way for a respectful discussion.
5316
Again, your comment overall very clearly clarified your position and argument that circumcision should be an ethical question rather than one of costs and benefits, I just found that last phrase to be a little outside the bounds of a mutually respectful discussion.
5317
Why is it called FGM and not female circumcision then?
5318
Because it's never been a common practice in the west, so no one in the west is offended by calling it mutilation.
5319
Circumcision does have a cultural history in the west, so calling it "mutilation", even if you believe that, alienates people who support it off the bat by making them feel like you consider them a barbaric monster.
5320
And maybe you do, but the point is that it makes actual discussion and trying to reach some conclusion much more difficult from the start, when presuming that's the point rather than just haranguing people on the opposite end of the spectrum for your own gratification.
5321
Granted, I think circumcision is silly and I expect to see it fade into obscurity with time.
5322
But I am commenting on a pragmatic element of the debate that anti-circumcision advocates tend to miss.
5323
It doesn't matter if you feel so strongly that deep down you think your opponents do deserve to be called supporters of "mutilation".
5324
You can't fucking say that to them and expect them to think you're still treating them like another person in good faith.
5325
They will shut down the conversation from the outset and write you off, and then you've accomplished precisely nothing.
5326
Americans are weird
5327
Its cool, up until 2010 the AAP had a policy supporting female circumcision, and suggested that American doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial "nick" on girls.
5328
Wikipedia Article from Equality now NY times Article Ultimately they reversed that after a lot of angry letters.
5329
If you are mad, let them know.
5330
To be fair they were recommending it to stop religious individuals from sending women over seas for full FGM, which is terrible, but in reality we live in a terrible world
5331
Wait, where does it say they supported female circumcision?
5332
It says they supported the ceremonial prick in order to AVOID female circumcision.
5333
It's way easier to give an uncircumcised guy a handy.
5334
This should weigh in the values more heavily.
5335
The problem is many circumcisions are performed on humans who can not make decisions for themselves.
5336
Most health risks can be managed by simple hygiene.
5337
it's funny that they're using the same arguments as "doctors" in Africa practising female cirumcision.
5338
I am actually reading the white paper now.
5339
If they reference AFRICA one more fucking time.
5340
Why does the AMERICAN Association of Pediatrics make recommendation for American physicals based on data out of AFRICA?
5341
I love this quote about Herpes Simplex Type 2: One meta-analysis with good evidence found some protective effect of circumcision against HSV-2 of borderline statistical significance.
5342
Then the article goes on to talk about AFRICA AGAIN!
5343
I'll keep reading through it.
5344
That's why you need to make sure you wash your penis after sexual contact.
5345
Circumcised or otherwise .period.
5346
There's been plenty of men who have been circumcised in adulthood and not noticed any negative impact on sensation.
5347
This argument seems to be based on speculation "if I lose it it'd be awful" which isn't a strong argument.
5348
Last time Reddit had a discussion regarding this there were a few first-hand accounts that elected to get circumcised at 16-21 years old.
5349
They all said after healing there was little to know difference in sexual sensation.
5350
It was different but equally as good as before.
5351
People shouldn't take a stance on the fact that it diminishes pleasure when they haven't had the surgery done themselves and experienced both sides.
5352
Thanks for finding this, it should be a top post in this thread but there seems to be an uncut downvoting brigade at work here.
5353
First hand accounts match the science: http://arstechnica.com/science/2007/08/study-shows-circumcision-results-in-no-loss-of-sexual-sensation/
5354
I can't help but think that their study doesn't control for sociological factors, people who are uncircumcised may just be brought up in a place or in a way which makes them more susceptible to HIV.
5355
I dont fucking care, I don't want my dick maimed without my consent.
5356
That's why they do it before you can speak.
5357
All of these "risks" could be avoided by avoiding unprotected sex and simply cleaning your junk properly.
5358
As a society, are we really so lazy as to resort to sponsoring archaic forms of ritualistic genital mutilation simply because we're too lazy to slap on a condom or run a bar of soap over our crotches?
5359
I think we need to stop thinking of the male genital system as having no diversity.
5360
Women recognize that sexuality is different for every woman, so I think we should recognize what for you was no biggy would be a much bigger deal to another guy.
5361
My son is 2, uncircumcised, has never had a UTI or any kind of problems with his penis.
5362
I do not pull his foreskin back for any reason or attempt to clean under it, as I was properly educated to by doctors when I had him.
5363
I think part of the problem of foreskins are people who are misinformed about them and try to clean under it and cause tears and pain.
5364
When he is old enough I will teach him and encourage proper safe sex practices, abstinence only education will only harm the teens and young adults who are sexually active or going to be.
5365
If he wants to get a circumsicion when he is old enough to decide for himself that's something he wants, than he has my support for that as well.
5366
I really just can't in good faith support cutting off any future son's foreskin when he is an infant.
5367
If my hypothetical son is interested in getting it done when he is older and old enough to understand the procedure, I would support him in it.
5368
But doing this to babies just seems wrong to me.
5369
there's money to be made out of circumcision, don't touch the business
5370
Phew, thanks for letting me know this, America.
5371
Suddenly the UK's long standing problems with UTIs and HIV are explained.
5372
I mean it's an epidemic over here!
5373
Oh no wait.
5374
Even if circumcision could slightly decrease the risk of HIV transmission (and I hope this doesn't come as a shock to people), BABIES AREN'T SLEEPING AROUND BAREBACK.
5375
Therefore, a permanent body modification based on this dubious future medical protection of small magnitude shouldn't be the parents' prerogative.
5376
How many of you would be okay with your parents giving you a permanent tattoo when you were a few days old and couldn't defend your point of view?
5377
And that's not even a good analogy, because the tattoo could be lasered off, whereas even if a person stretches their skin for years they can never truly replace their foreskin.
5378
If an adult male wishes to be circumcised because, based on his own sexual choices, he feels the slightly decreased HIV transmission risk makes the procedure a good idea.then
5379
fine.
5380
But letting a child have their body be permanently modified without their consent (and possibly against their future wishes, as is often the case) is unethical to me.
5381
I have a child who is uncircumcised, and if you clean properly and teach him proper hygiene, then you won't have any problems.
5382
He hasn't had any urinary tract infections or anything like that.
5383
We made the decision not to have him cut after a few of our friends did and had to go back to the hospital after the doctors botched it.
5384
Just in case he feels like it's something he needs to do, my wife and I have put money into an account to pay for one once he gets old enough to decided whether or not he wants it done.
5385
And the angry responses begin to appear.
5386
Citing a continued failure of the AAP to recognize the unique sensory functions of the male foreskin, Guest asserted that, "A growing number of medical associations now recognize that an intact penis with a foreskin enhances sexual pleasure for the male and his partner."
5387
According to Guest, in 2010 the Royal Dutch Medical Association concluded "the foreskin is a complex erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts."
5388
Guest also faults the AAP for relying on methodologically weak African trials claiming HIV is lower in circumcised men.
5389
He says the studies also contradict global HIV trends, citing the United States, with a high circumcision rate, yet a significantly higher rate of HIV infection than Sweden and Japan where circumcision is rare.
5390
"Even if the African trials are scientifically valid, they cannot be used to justify infant circumcision in North America where the incidence of heterosexual HIV transmission is low."
5391
(AAP Circumcision Policy 'Seriously Flawed', Condemned by Canadian Children's Rights Group)
5392
That doesn't sound angry as much as it sounds like relevant counter-arguments.
5393
these "benefits" were known before and they are all bullshit.
5394
UTIs are rare to begin with and easily treatable, if girls can be taught hygiene so can uncircumcised boys.
5395
As far as prevention of STDs, circumcision doesn't even come close to allowing for unprotected sex so it's a moot point.
5396
What is a fact however is that the body of a person is being violated and a sensitive, sexually functional part of the body is destroyed.
5397
Lastly there is a tremendous status quo bias here.
5398
Imagine if someone wanted to remove earlobes from babies.
5399
What health benefits would need to be PROVEN effective for us to allow routine earlobe removal?
5400
I am guessing much more than we have.
5401
People defend it because they don't want to feel cheated or like monsters for what they did to their child.
5402
Lastly ask any male with a normal, healthy foreskin if he would like to get rid of it.
5403
It's inconceivable.
5404
It's a useful, functional sex organ for masturbation and intercourse.
5405
Keeps the gland of the penis internal and moist and soft.
5406
I was circumcised at 23, 2 years ago, and I dont get the big deal.
5407
Sex still feels great, I last longer, dont find it any harder to come, I notice literally no difference at all, I dont miss my foreskin.
5408
I dont get all the arguing, both are fine.
5409
Ohhh, scientific data and the Reddit anti-circumcision circlejerk collide.
5410
How enjoyable.
5411
We'll cure cancer by giving everyone diabetes!
5412
GENIUS!
5413
(/sarcasm) Seriously though, wouldn't increasing pyruvate kinase activity increase ATP levels and thus increase amount of glucose in the blood stream or did I not pay close enough attention in biology 101?
5414
Their study varies two parameters at the same time—physical activity and weight—and then astonishingly leaps to the conclusion that only one of the parameters affects health: weight.
5415
This is in contradiction to Westerner-only studies that find physical activity improves health dramatically regardless of other factors.
5416
Conclusion: bad science.
5417
Nothing new here, but glad to see confirmation.
5418
You cant outrun (literally) a bad diet.
5419
The typical western weather is different; You burn may burn at least 5-10% more calories just for heavier clothes.
5420
We think that the Hadzas?
5421
bodies have adjusted to the higher activity levels required for hunting and gathering by spending less energy elsewhere.
5422
Even for very active people, physical activity accounts for only a small portion of daily energy expenditure; most energy is spent behind the scenes on the myriad unseen tasks that keep our cells humming and our support systems working.
5423
If the Hadza’s bodies somehow manage to spend less energy in those areas, they could easily accommodate the elevated energy demands of hunting and gathering.
5424
And indeed, studies reporting differences in metabolic-hormone profiles between traditional and Western populations support this idea (though more work is needed).
5425
I think this more boils down to the fact that there is no way we can know with any certainty what people did 3000 or more years ago.
5426
Its all just conjecture,
5427
I hate when biologist pretend to be real scientists.
5428
I've always been stunned with people who outright refuse that animals perceive the world very similarly to the way we do.
5429
You know, "Oh, it's not in pain, it's just reacting negatively to what you're doing for self preservation".
5430
Oh, right, like pain.
5431
"Oh, it's not scared like we are, it's a different scared.
5432
Can't tell you why, but it's totally not like the emotion we feel".
5433
It's frustrating, I'm one of those SAP people who connects better with animals than other people, and to me it seems so obvious when you spend time with animals that they're capable of trains of thought or emotion, but so many people are dead-set in their belief that rather than being co-living-organisms, we're somehow superior due to unspecified magic.
5434
I can only hope studies like this slowly shift the paradigms.
5435
Non-human Animals are as "With It" as Humans FTFY.
5436
We're animals, too.
5437
I know it's taken directly from the article, but it's bad enough to fix anyway.
5438
If the asserted conclusion is correct, then perhaps the common error humans make is to conflate sapience with sentience.
5439
Perhaps sentience and sapience have a superset-subset relationship.
5440
Perhaps our fluid, dynamic clusters of (for lack of a better phrase) "intent-values-perceptions" that make us creatures of action are not unique to sapience, but rather a basic property of sentience irrespective of what form it takes.
5441
Perhaps the cognitive differences between us humans and other animals is a matter of scope rather than substance; perhaps it is a matter of gradient, shade, continuum.
5442
That being said, I'm still eating my goddamn bacons.
5443
I have been making this argument for years.
5444
I have been ridiculed at every turn.
5445
Still eat meat though.
5446
The article links to an article about animal language.
5447
One paragraph talks about decoding dolphin language, suggesting that they may not even have a language with syntax.
5448
Perhaps they indeed have no language, but the clicks and whistle are actually signals that their brains turn into visual images for visual processing.
5449
Humans with synesthesia have the ability to see sounds as colors and understand numbers as smells or flashes of colors.
5450
Therefore, it would not be a stretch to think that some animals have no internal monologue, all their thoughts take place as internal imagining.
5451
Visualize a complex task and then complete that task without thinking with your internal monologue.
5452
Note that your internal monologue is ever present.
5453
As soon or before you visualize an object or a task, there is an accompanying sound describing it.
5454
Visualize a cup, and you'll internal monologue will echo "cup."
5455
Relevant article on dolphin communication: http://www.somatic.com/articles/dolphins.pdf
5456
The dolphin's situation is quite different.
5457
It communicates using the same acoustic sense with which it perceives, and it is probably capable of directly transmitting imagery to another dolphin.
5458
It has the ability to communicate, in other words, in a manner that would be analogous to direct transmission of visual imagery from one human mind to another.
5459
The dolphin constructs its image of the environment from the pair of acoustical waveforms arriving at its two acoustic receptors.
5460
The dolphin also has two separate sound-producing organs which it can use together as well as independently.
5461
It can thus transmit as well as receive stereophonically.
5462
Before people get their animal-rights hats on, lets consider what this means.
5463
It won't make a stronger moral case for the various forms of vegetarianism or the vegan lifestyle.
5464
Simply by elevating so many forms of life to the same level of "with it" or consciousness you haven't changed the predator vs. prey relationship.
5465
A lion still eats other animals despite being perfectly conscious of it.
5466
It might make a stronger case for more compassionate treatment of animals.
5467
But lets be honest, we rarely treat people with the respect and compassion they deserve and we've been aware of our own self-awareness for much longer.
5468
Stronger arguments for better animal welfare can be made via sustainability, environmental benefits and improvements in food quality and respect for the sources of food.
5469
About the only thing it should do is make our relationship with and our study of other animals a little more nuanced.
5470
i.e.
5471
The elephant did because it felt this emotion rather than it followed its instinctual programming.
5472
Philosophically, ethics is logically justified through the social contract.
5473
Those animals with which we can meaningfully communicate deserve the protections of that contract.
5474
Chickens may well be conscious, but we can't come to any understanding with them, therefore they cannot be subject to the social contract.
5475
This is a terrible headline.
5476
I don't care that it's copied from the article.
5477
It's bad enough that you can be expected to do better.
5478
Animals are more "with it I would strongly argue".
5479
Some humans can be more in tune with nature than others but most animals are consistently in tune with it.
5480
I always have mixed feelings about the results of these studies.
5481
Obviously it isn't always possible for infants to get breast milk.
5482
If it were possible to deliver the same benefits from formulas that would be great, but I would hate to see women using artificial products instead of breast feeding when they are able to breast feed.
5483
Women along with infants get so many health benefits from breast feeding that they would be missing out on even if their children were given a formula identical to naturally produced milk.
5484
I find it interesting that in publicly funded studies, breast milk always comes out as better.
5485
In privately funded studies, formula tends to meet (or at least near) breast milk on a specific subject being tested for.
5486
Breasts are purposeful.
5487
Interesting studies out today.
5488
This one and the BPA one.
5489
This one states the microbiota of breastfed babies is beneficial, the other states BPA is causing autism.
5490
So if you put these side by side what is happening with a formula fed baby?
5491
They are not getting a good gut microbiota AND their formula has high levels of BPA (formula cans are lined with BPA).
5492
So, these formula fed babies are getting a double whammy which could be leading to the recent rise in autism.
5493
Breastfed babies have their robust microbiota that possibly helps them fend off BPA induced autism.
5494
What I would like to know are: the number of autistic children that were EXCLUSIVELY breastfeed for the first 2 years of life vs.
5495
Formula fed.
5496
When I say exclusive I mean exclusive, not breastfeed for 3 months then given other food sources.
5497
I think the results would be staggering.
5498
as a medical student, i'm surprised this is considered news.
5499
i learned about this two years ago.
5500
breast milk is also beneficial in transferring certain immune response antibodies to protect the newborn baby.
5501
the gut bacteria population is also linked to the immune system in that newborns are still weeding out T-cells, if i'm remembering this correctly.
5502
if a baby isn't exposed to a certain common antigen during this developmental stage, it could potentially lead to allergy problems later on in life, i think.
5503
it'd be interesting to see the comparative rates of auto-immune disorders between breast-fed and formula-fed children throughout their lives.
5504
bottom line, though, if you pop out a baby, go ahead and pop out the boobs too
5505
just fyi the correct scientific term is microbiota, not "flora" (because bacteria aren't plants)
5506
huh. shouldn't it be something besdies flora?
5507
that means plant life.
5508
and bacteria aren't plants.
5509
Breastfeeding right now! Woot!
5510
Urgh.
5511
Every top level comment can be summed up as "duh, obviously, and anyone that doesn't breast feed is the devil".
5512
Know what, kiddies?
5513
It ain't that easy.
5514
And "breast is best in all cases" dogma is one of the main reasons why many women who could breast feed choose not to - they have bad advice on the realities of both options, because WHO regs forbid healthcare options from discussing formula in a remotely positive light (thereby resulting in purely anecdotal advice, such as "give a baby formula before bed and they'll sleep longer") Not every woman is capable of breast feeding.
5515
My wife was simply unable to produce enough milk to feed our son - with a double pump every couple of hours, and forgoing essentially all sleep for 3 weeks solid, she was able to produce at beast half his required intake.
5516
And we went as far as using off-label drugs to increase supply, which inevitably failed to produce results.
5517
We ended up on formula out of necessity, yet society (and just look at the other comments here) judged harshly as a result.
5518
And even for women who don't have supply issues, how long could you go without proper sleep?
5519
24 hours?
5520
48?
5521
With a breastfeeding baby demanding feeding every 2 hours, try 100+ hours with nothing more than broken naps.
5522
Oh, sure, express & have the partner do some of the feeds, that works too - except you have folks like beanhacker proclaiming that this will cause autism via BPA in the bottle and pump plastics, and know what?
5523
Pumping takes time too, and so does all the cleaning, so you're looking at even less sleepytime.
5524
That shit is hard.
5525
A little less judgement from people who haven't had to go through it would be lovely.
5526
Nobody says that breast feeding your baby will cause autism etc. Whereas you proclaimed the reverse.
5527
And that's not in the least an unusual situation.
5528
Is it any surprise people would feel defensive?
5529
We all know that breast is best, but militancy in enforcing that view on everyone, regardless of situation, makes things worse for everybody.
5530
Random example: which brand of formula is the best to feed my baby, given breast feeding is not physically an option?
5531
I don't know, because my healthcare provider is prohibited from advising me on that front.
5532
Good job, breast feeding advocates!
5533
The female body has been giving birth for as long as women have existed, but we still use modern medicine to reduce infant mortality.

Evolution is great, but it doesn't do everything.

This post is almost helpful.

BMI is a pretty lousy measure of obesity.
5539
I'd like to see a comparison of belly fat with body fat percentage.
5540
The article also didn't state whether they controlled for activity levels.
5541
Now they tell me!
5542
Makes sense.

Unfortunately all the men in my family store most fat at their bellies.

Fortunately I'm very lean and active.

Chemical Vapor Deposition is a known killer.
5546
From this title, isn't that like every man on the planet over 40?
5547
This ignores the natural selection requiring a molecule to store genetic information that is self replicating with variation.
5548
For DNA to arise before life, requires a person to assume that life would arise by an unknown form of replication and absorb the DNA molecules.
5549
The article makes a more amazing claim than the RNA world hypothesis and needs evidence fitting it.
5550
A non-biological, continuous, and replicable method of producing DNA in excess.
5551
While at the same time, under the conditions of producing other molecules required for abiogenesis.
5552
I was imagining this process and came up with the following: Life did not arise and absorb DNA, but rather evolved together.
5553
We know lipid like structures and amino acids existed concurrently.
5554
The reason DNA works so well is the property of the constituent molecules to bind readily.
5555
This is also why they are good at forming proteins.
5556
In the early "soup" DNA probably randomly combined and broke away, especially where churned up near volcanic activity, sometimes leaving protein strands.
5557
Lipids have been proven to naturally form into "cell like" structures, which are more or less permeable.
5558
Random snippets of DNA, likely were absorbed by these cells, including the bits that formed aforementioned protein strands.
5559
As other material is absorbed into the lipid cells containing the DNA strands that code for protein fibers.
5560
This material is formed into multiple strands of fiber which are absorbed by the lipid "skin".
5561
This has the effect of making some of those structures selectively permeable, allowing the protein coding DNA to be protected and retained.
5562
Over time these cells begin to become more prevalent, producing more and more fibers of varying properties until the protocell splits under its own size, sometimes sectioning off bits of the protein coding DNA, allowing for differing cells with slightly nuanced properties.
5563
this process over time evolves into the first self replicating cells.
5564
I don't understand the quote in the title.
5565
How would "organisms" exist if DNA hadn't been formed yet?
5566
I hate these kinds of articles, not because I don't believe in the abiotic origins of life but because it always is some small, usually already known, putative aspect of life origins, but everybody takes it as some fundamental explanatory discovery.
5567
It's easy to seem profound when talking about the origins of life, so it lends itself to this sort of hype.
5568
I wonder if allergy shot treatment before a woman becomes pregnant would help lessen the risk of autism in her children.
5569
DNA Turning Human Story Into a Tell-All When modern humans mated with them, they got an injection of helpful genetic immune material, so useful that it remains in the genome today.
5570
This suggests that modern humans needed the archaic DNA to survive.
5571
The downside of archaic immune material is that it may be responsible for autoimmune diseases like diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis, Dr. Parham said, stressing that these are preliminary results.
5572
Autism: The Eusocial Hominid Hypothesis ASDs (autism spectrum disorders) are hypothesized as one of many adaptive human cognitive variations that have been maintained in modern populations via multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
5573
Introgression from "archaic" hominids (adapted for less demanding social environments) is conjectured as the source of initial intraspecific heterogeneity because strict inclusive fitness does not adequately model the evolution of distinct, copy-number sensitive phenotypes within a freely reproducing population.
5574
Evidence is given of divergent encephalization and brain organization in the Neanderthal (including a ~1520 cc cranial capacity, larger than that of modern humans) to explain the origin of the autism subgroup characterized by abnormal brain growth.
5575
Autism and immune dysfunction are frequently comorbid.
5576
This supports an admixture model in light of the recent discovery that MHC alleles (genes linked to immune function, mate selection, neuronal "pruning," etc.) found in most modern human populations come from "archaic" hominids.
5577
Mitochondrial dysfunction, differential fetal androgen exposure, lung abnormalities, and hypomethylation/CNV due to hybridization are also presented as evidence.

My day-job is in autism research, and I can say with certainty that this author greatly overstates the potential role of autoimmunity in the etiology of autism.
5580
The big news in autism research is the three big papers that have come out over the last few months in very high-profile journals, each independently linking age-related paternal mutations to autism prevalence.
5581
These studies were written up in the NYT only a few days ago, but this piece does not even make mention of them.
5582
I think chronic inflammation is definitely a component of the disorder, but this author seems to have a pre-set story and is ignoring important evidence that does not conform.
5583
It is a clear overstatement to say that "An Immune Disorder at the Root of Autism."
5584
There may be some evidence in that direction, but the case is far from closed.
5585
Pretty much.
5586
Make your kids wait till they are 18-21 to start smoking unless they have cancer.
5587
The earlier and heavier you smoke the more it will jack up your memory.
5588
"Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users."
5589
=(
5590
I'm 92 and started when I was 83, guess it don't matter now!
5591
The Guardian has just posted an article about this study.
5592
They're reporting the study indicates a drop of 8 IQ points in adolescent users.
5593
Marijuana is not harmless, particularly for adolescents," said Madeline Meier from Duke, one of the researchers.
5594
While eight IQ points on a scale where the mean is 100 may not sound a lot, she said, a drop from 100 to 92 represents a move from the 50th to the 29th percentile.
5595
Higher IQs correlate with higher education and income, better health and a longer life.
5596
Edit: The BBC also have an article For example, researchers found that individuals who started using cannabis in adolescence and then carried on using it for years showed an average eight-point IQ decline.
5597
I think it's important to understand what this research paper actually says and also what its limitations are.
5598
The association between childhood cannabis use and subsequent cognitive decline as an adult is not a new idea in scientific literature.
5599
There are several papers already that show this association; this PNAS paper only reinforces it.
5600
What's new here is that they control for several variables such as alcohol and hard-drug dependence and education level that could also influence cognitive ability (these were likely criticisms of previous papers).
5601
They also say they perform more rigorous tests for cognitive abilities than previously done and show that this association is present even after cessation of cannabis use.
5602
They mention that while possible, there is no direct implication of a cause or mechanism here, like 'childhood cannabis use causes brain changes that lead to cognitive decline in adults' (which unfortunately is probably going to be closer to what news headlines read).
5603
This paper does not say that.
5604
It only says that people who use cannabis during childhood are more likely to score lower on cognitive ability tests as adults.
5605
They also say that there is a possibility of factor(s) unaccounted for that could result in the observed numbers.
5606
Theoretically for instance, there could be a "Factor X" that during childhood leads to both increased chance of cannabis use and cognitive decline through adulthood.
5607
This is a pretty significant possibility in my opinion.
5608
My wife is a psychologist and while earning her master's degree she participated in a study determining the effects of marijuana on adolescent brain development.
5609
Unfortunately, teenage usage of marijuana is likely to stunt the growth of the frontal cortex (as shown on the brain scans), which quickly develops during adolescence.
5610
Therefore, it can severely inhibit the development of judgment and reasoning skills.
5611
I should note, "adolescence" often extends into your early 20s, especially with males.
5612
Adult men and women saw practically no negative results from the study.
5613
I say this as a former longtime medical cannabis user: if you use mind-altering substances of any kind, you can't expect there to be no adverse consequences.
5614
This pipe dream (hurr) of a totally safe, totally happy drug that does nothing but make things better is a lie.
5615
Getting high brings a whole slew of baggage along with the immediate good feelings.
5616
Users and pro-legalization advocates would add some credibility to their arguments if there was a dash of honesty thrown in.
5617
I think pro-marijuana advocates are just afraid that people who are already against legalization will now have more ammo.
5618
Whether marijuana is dangerous or not really doesn't make a big difference to me when it comes to whether or not we should legalize it.
5619
There are a million household products that can kill us if we decide to abuse them, but that doesn't mean we need the government making those decisions for us.
5620
People will smoke marijuana if they want to, and no law is going to change that.
5621
What it will do is waste our tax payer money, imprison non-violent people, and keep drug dealers and cartels in business.
5622
I wish I was not high right now.
5623
As someone questioning whether or not they have what it takes to make it through grad school, this is a little depressing.
5624
Sometimes I genuinely wonder if I have impaired my scholastic abilities after smoking for nearly 9 years.
5625
This will probably get buried but I'll post it anyway.
5626
Take note my story is on the more extreme end compared to what/how much most people do at the age I started smoking but nonetheless.
5627
I started smoking weed very young.
5628
From ages 13-15 I smoked just about every single day at least once a day.
5629
I'd say the amount I smoked in this 2 year period just to myself would be around 3+ pounds.
5630
At first there were no problems, I could smoke like a chimney and go eat dinner with my mom 10 minutes later.
5631
It quickly got to a point to where I HAD to smoke, if I didn't my whole day would be off and I just would not feel normal.
5632
This continued for about 2 years, then literally out of no where the high itself completely changed.
5633
Instead of feeling relaxed and normal I would get super paranoid, and just weirded out.
5634
I would think everyone is looking at me and start over analyzing every situation, and just some really weird shit so eventually I stopped smoking.
5635
Turns out smoking so much during the early stages of adolescence (when your brain is developing and chemicals are flying everywhere and gluatmene, dopamine, serotonin and whatever the hell else is rapidly changing) can disrupt whats supposed to happen naturally which is what happened.
5636
My brain did not develop correctly.
5637
Now (at 22) I'm pretty much in the previously stated paranoid high state I would get right before I stopped smoking - all the time even though I haven't touched any drugs or alcohol since I was 17 and haven't smoked weed since 15.
5638
Its nothing crazy just some pretty severe social anxiety, ect.
5639
I'm not going to blame it all on the weed.
5640
I may have ended up this way no matter what who knows, but I do think it played a very big role.
5641
Doctors/psychs have also told me the same.
5642
Weed is probably fine in strict moderation even at a young age and fine in larger amounts at 18-20+ but if you're young don't over do it.
5643
There is a critical stage of brain development that you don't want messed up.
5644
Now of course everyones brain is different.I know people who have been smoking for 15 years since they were 15 and you would not be able to tell.
5645
At the end of the day its not worth it.
5646
I'm not saying never touch weed in your life and its the devil just don't smoke too much.
5647
Don't make it a necessity and the thing your life revolves around.
5648
Also don't let anyone tell you its not addictive and its harmless.
5649
Thats just not true.
5650
Now its not on the same level of addictiveness as coke, meth, ect.
5651
but if you take a liking to the high it it can grab you by the balls before you realize.
5652
Reddit is so into science until science dares to suggest weed is bad for you.
5653
Well that is horrible news.
5654
Regardless of whether there is an actual neurological effect, "persistent cannabis use" from a young age often accompanies a lifestyle not conducive to intellectual development.
5655
I smoke from time to time but my lifestyle does not revolve around it like many of my friends lives do.
5656
I have seen kids with once promising futures decline into daily use, they give nothing back to society and sit on their asses smoking all day.
5657
That's not to say weed isn't great, it is, just don't go overboard.
5658
All things in modesty.
5659
Even as an Ent I agree with this.
5660
I have had a speech impairment my entire life but started smoke around 16. My social skills were shot and I have a stutter where I can't get works past my lips at all.
5661
Being stoned made it worse and harder to control.
5662
Even though I maintained good grades I could tell it had an effect on my brain.
5663
Sometimes I wish I hadn't started smoking at 14sucks bein bored in the suburbs though.
5664
I'm 21 now and in college and doing well.
5665
Not a genius but sometimes I do think I might be a little sharper if I hadn't smoked weed so early.
5666
Although I didn't start smoking heavily/daily until I was about 17/18.
5667
This is why, even as someone who smoked pot, I tend to find terms like "stoner" or "pothead" pejorative.
5668
I don't like to be called a stoner.
5669
At the same time I enjoy my quality of life and have many hearty laughs with my friends.
5670
I couldn't really wish for too much better.
5671
Now what if they taught this in schools.Instead of: "Marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are bad and you should just say no!" Let's have: "Drugs are a serious thing you will encounter in life.
5672
You can make your own decisions, but know the facts."
5673
High school students would listen if you talk to them like adults.
5674
Reddit you are such a drama queen.
5675
This was on my front page and currently has 698 upvotes and 184 down.
5676
Given that there's some auto downvoting algorithm that is always used, this does not have many downvotes at all.
5677
Still, all the top comments are about how people are downvoting it or how it's getting downvoted because it says negative things about marijuana.
5678
This is clearly NOT TRUE.
5679
Quit being such drama queens.
5680
Doesn't this parallel findings with tobacco use?
5681
Either cannabis or tobacco, it makes sense that frequently lowering oxygen levels to the brain through smoking in the formative years of adolescence would have some affect on the brain.
5682
what I'm wondering is whether or not the decline is due to a direct effect of cannabis on the brain, or if it's due (at least in part) to the laziness that's associated with its use.
5683
It's well documented that "exercising" your brain in specific ways helps it to function better on these same tasks.
5684
So, if heavy cannabis use leads to a decrease in these kinds of exercises, perhaps it is only an indirect cause?
5685
Being a regular user I am of the belief that you shouldn't be ingesting any mind altering substances until you're at least 18.
5686
Taking any kind of drug or alcohol while your brain is still in crucial stages of development is going to have negative effects later in life.
5687
I wish I waited until I was a bit older before I started smoking marijuana but to be completely honest, that's my only regret when it comes to the sweet sweet cannabis.
5688
Negative side effects won't justify why it's illegal.
5689
Honest question: is it not the case that after reaching their peak, pretty much all humans show "neuropsychological decline" over time?
5690
I thought it was pretty well accepted that kids shouldn't be using psychoactive substances regularly while their brain is still developing, no matter how safe they are for adults.
5691
I wonder how damaging alcohol would be.
5692
I'd like to see the details of this study, mostly because we need a theory or hypothesis on what is going on, biologically.
5693
My concern is that heavy users are self-medicating and aren't fulfilling their potential for other reasons than the pot.
5694
Personally, I have been a heavy user since junior high, and I am highly functional and I know highly functional users of drugs other than pot.
5695
We are all just self-medicating, and it would be my suggestion that this study needs to be repeated and brain scans need to be made so that we can physically see what is going on.
5696
I'm not saying this study is wrong, but I am distrustful because there have been SOOO many other studies that have had severe flaws for the purposes of propaganda in this realm.
5697
I know I shouldn't be going off anecdotal experiences, but I am as sharp as a tack in my professional life, and I tend to run circles around most people.
5698
I do office politics like a boss, I work harder than everyone else, maintain a high energy level because that is my personality.
5699
The drugs nay have something to do with it, but I keep my drug use on the down low and most people have no idea when I am using or even that I am a user.
5700
Neuropsychological decline is the new term for super-groovy state of mind, yes?
5701
Started smoking at 14, can confirm.
5702
Persistent use of anything causes negative effects.
5703
Smoking cigarettes, alcohol, drug use, even soda.
5704
If you use it enough everything becomes negative.
5705
Am I advocating the use of marijuana for teens?
5706
No, but I think it's common sense that routine use of anything can be bad.
5707
Edit: I would also like to say that this life style of "if I do it, it will kill me" really annoys me.
5708
I drink way too much soda, specifically coca-cola.
5709
I hear all the time about how it's bad for me and all these negative effects.
5710
I could honestly care less.
5711
Sure in 40 or 50 years I'll be dealing with side effects but I'm not gonna worry about it.
5712
From the second we are born we start dying, we get closer and closer to death with every passing second.
5713
Some are closer than others and no one knows the hour of their death.
5714
The victims of the 9/11 attacks did not know that it was their last day on Earth.
5715
Tomorrow I could be driving and something happen and I would die.
5716
If I had worried about drinking too much soda then my short life would have been wasted on freaking out.
5717
So if anyone reads this at the bottom of the comments, don't worry about anything.
5718
Worry about living every day to the fullest, whether that's smoking pot, drinking alcohol or whatever.
5719
If you enjoy it then it's not wasted, fuck the rest.
5720
this article shows correlation, not causation, perhaps the kind of people who would regularly break the law before the age of 18 have lower IQ scores and it the cause is not cannabis, or any other number of factors, until they prove causation this does not necessarily mean its bad for kids, but it definitely suggests it, under 18's go through a lot of change body wise and it isn't wise to do many drugs that are ok after you are done developing
5721
Well.no point in stopping now, I guess.
5722
English, please?
5723
How did they find 13 year olds that were going to develop into daily smokers?
5724
Or do I not get it?
5725
In other news, doing stuff too young can have repercussions in later life.
5726
I was under the assumption it was due to the availability of food typically being highest during the summer, so people are more likely to have sex as they don't have to spend their entire time surviving.
5727
Then the baby gestates through the winter and is born in the spring - with time to grow stronger before the next winter.
5728
We all know what this means.

"there is no why"
5731
I was hoping for evidence of huge insects the size of a baseball, not tiny microscopic ones.
5732
Things that eat misquitos: Birds, Dragonfly's, fish, frogs/toads.
5733
They are food for a ton of species and their ease of multiplying provides a huge amount of sustenance to many animals.
5734
minnows eat them, bigger fish eat the minnows and even bigger fish eat those.
5735
Bears eat the big fish.
5736
Introduce her to a hungry bear.
5737
Paragraph 4, "They live on almost every continent andhabitat, and serve important functions in numerous ecosystems."
5738
Fuck mosquitoes, but they ARE important to the ecosystem and this lady doesn't know what she's talking about
5739
Without mosquitoes, thousands of plant species would lose a group of pollinators.
5740
Adults depend on nectar for energy (only females of some species need a meal of blood to get the proteins necessary to lay eggs).
5741
Yet McAllister says that their pollination isn’t crucial for crops on which humans depend.
5742
“If there was a benefit to having them around, we would have found a way to exploit them,?
5743
she says.
5744
“We haven’t wanted anything from mosquitoes except for them to go away.? Am I the only one around here who thinks this attitude is insane?
5745
Fish farmer here, I can't believe that this is even up for discussion.
5746
There are freshwater animals that depend on mosquito larvae to survive (minnows, for instance).
5747
It seems to me that eradicating an entire species would have a severe impact on the food chains of various ecosystems.
5748
Disclaimer: I'm not any sort of zoologist, just someone who's observed freshwater habitats for a couple of decades.

Janet Fang is an intern in Nature’s Washington DC office 'Nuff said

You know which species has no ecologic importance?
5751
Humans

"offers the gravid females blood to suck from the bellies of unconscious mice ?
5753
they drain 24 of the rodents a month."
5754
Damn, unconscious or not, I feel sorry for the mice.
5755
Makes me want to put up a bat habitat to equal things out.
5756
Law of unintended consequences: For every action there is an unexpected reaction.
5757
Intentionally taking species to extinction because humans don't find them of value is kinda retarded.
5758
This settles it.
5759
We must come together to destroy the mosquitos.
5760
at least not until we found out what it is.
5761
Like possibly spreading DNA to other creatures via blood
5762
I hate mosquitoes just as much as the next guy, But this article does not at all make a strong case for its thesis statement and the anthropocentric bias is glaring.
5763
OP has either not read the article or has drawn a conclusion totally opposite of the text of said article.
5764
this is perhaps the most insane "scientific" paper I've ever read.
5765
The entire thing consists of her giving lots of evidence of the ecological importance of mosquitoes, then using that evidence to come to the conclusion that mosquitoes aren't ecologically important.
5766
I honestly don't know how this paper was written.
5767
It would have made much more sense to just ignore the evidence outright and say there is none.
5768
Lots of mosquito lovers posting here.
5769
Well I don't care how important they are to the ecosystem or not, I'd still happily welcome their total extinction.
5770
If they have an ecological importance, fine, let them stay.
5771
But only the silent ones.
5772
Get rid of that noisy bzzzzz bitches!
5773
Why on hell do they need to do so much noise?
5774
From the article:"They are lethally efficient at sucking blood from one individual and mainlining it into another, providing an ideal route for the spread of pathogenic microbes."
5775
Do mosquitoes actually inject blood?
5776
I was under the impression they inject saliva that acted as anti-coagulant.
5777
Malaria resides in the saliva, part of the life cycle.
5778
But the mossie won't inject blood.
5779
They probably serve a better importance than some dumb ass carbon based life form fucking everything up, and killing things including itself lol! Bit daft, misconceptions as far as the sun.
5780
The blood they drink gives vital nutrients to the animals which eat them.
5781
I love this.
5782
We should send this paper to our congresspeople and senators.
5783
Like, honestly, I think this would be a great thing to start happening.
5784
good article.
5785
thanks
5786
I wish all political articles were written like this.
5787
I love when science is neutral politically.
5788
Nothing particularly new was said here, but it definitely is written less anti-conservative as I've seen some which is nice, and I'm writing this as a liberal.
5789
Interesting insights, but the purported study seemed extremely small and possibly flawed.
5790
That, and lower intelligence.

I don't want scientists to stop working until they have grown synthetic skin that replaces bark on trees, glows in the dark in a custom-designed hue -and- can be used to help burn victims.

Also anus headed, according to that diagram.
